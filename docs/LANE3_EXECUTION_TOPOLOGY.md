# Lane 3 execution topology: organization-owned, workflow-restricted, ephemeral

- **Status:** Proposed design, 2026-10-05. On 2026-10-05 Michael Ayoade chose
  this direction (organization-owned Lane 3 execution, a dedicated
  workflow-restricted runner group with a protected Environment, ephemeral
  runners, an amended rehearsal oracle, and retirement of the personal runner
  and its static credentials). The concrete coordinates, paths and defaults
  below are **proposals awaiting review**, not provisioned facts. This
  document grants no provisioning, host, secret, release, deployment or
  risk-acceptance authority.
- **Owning contracts:** ADR-0070 (amendment 2026-10-05 records this decision);
  `AGENTS.md` rules 30, 44 and 51; Platform CP ADR-0013 § A7.6 (Lane 3 vantage
  configuration belongs to Starter/Foundation infrastructure); CP
  `docs/design/gate0-d-implementation-spec.md` § 8 (the unresolved
  private-vantage-delivery row this document answers) and § 11 (the public
  GitHub Free topology this document mirrors).
- **Coordinates, as of 2026-10-05 (re-read before acting):** Starter `main`
  `e066dd07671a96e5adf1740e8073e90573f3963e`; Platform CP `main`
  `bf1d16265be638eac2fc63583d60f5e1f3248529`; `dotmac-tech/gate0-issuer-execution`
  `main` `453ad4db44d0fe9ddf94748cd1fa124cdcc2d680` (repository ID
  `1397614140`, organization ID `335992433`).

## 0. What this closes, and what it does not

This is the Starter share of Gate-0 Work Packet D: a design for delivering the
Lane 3 observer, jump and inside-vantage configuration privately, and the
execution topology that makes that possible. It defines what D-S2 (workflow
and oracle source) and D-S3 (guards and tests) must implement, and the
evidence D's acceptance requires from Starter.

It does **not** close Packet D. D closes on live evidence: the provisioning
and refusal proofs in § 7, plus CP's own D items (JWT role, signers, trust
state, SSH CA, privileged Gate-0 runner). It does not close Work Packet E,
allocate or rehearse a Foundation candidate (Gates 2 and 3), or change the
four Lane 3 runner fixes in `docs/inventories/lane3-acceptance-criteria.md`.
Those fixes are tracked separately as D4 and are deliberately out of scope
here.

## 1. Why the current topology cannot be admitted

Measured read-only on 2026-10-05:

- **The repository is public and personal-account owned.**
  `control-runner-starter-mt` is registered to `michaelayoade/dotmac_starter_mt`
  (online, idle, labels `self-hosted, Linux, X64, dotmac-control-runner,
  dotmac-foundation-control`). A label routes a job; it does not restrict
  which workflow may use the runner. Workflow-restricted runner groups are an
  organization control, unavailable on a personal account. Anyone with write
  access can push a branch whose workflow selects
  `[self-hosted, dotmac-control-runner]`. The three self-hosted workflows on
  `main` use `workflow_dispatch` only, but nothing enforces that the next one
  will. The fork-PR approval policy (`all_external_contributors`) does not
  cover collaborators.
- **The topology is public.** `exposure-rehearsal.yml` reads
  `vars.LANE3_PROBE_HOST`, `vars.LANE3_INSIDE_VANTAGE`,
  `vars.LANE3_OBSERVER_USER` and the key-path variables, and passes them, along
  with the `target` and `vm_slot` dispatch inputs, as runner arguments.
  Repository variables are not masked. Dispatch inputs, logs and artifacts of a
  public repository are public.
- **The credentials are static and sit on a shared runner.** The controller
  key (`~/.dotmac/controller-<authorization_run>`), the observer key, the
  inside-vantage jump key and the probe-host key are long-lived files on the
  runner, readable by any step any workflow runs there. `RUNNER_QUERY_TOKEN`
  (`administration: read`) is a long-lived repository secret.
- **The evidence carries topology.** `RehearsalReceipt.v1` records `target`
  and `probe_identity`. `render_status_document` writes both into
  `deployment-exposure-rehearsal-status.md`. `probe-evidence.json` carries
  observed source addresses. All three are uploaded as artifacts.
  `collect_probe_evidence.sh` defaulted `LANE3_FORMER_PRIVATE_PATHS` to private
  addresses in tracked source (removed by R6, 2026-10-06).

Each of these is a refusal reason for § 7's admission, not a style nit.

## 2. Target topology

All names are proposals. Provisioning records the final exact coordinates and
updates this document and `.github/lane3-execution.json` (§ 6) in the same
change, before any runner registration.

| Element | Proposed coordinate | Required properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Execution repository | `dotmac-tech/lane3-exposure-execution` (public) | Holds the launcher workflow and nothing private. Protected `main`: PR required, zero required approvals (solo owner), required non-privileged checks, admin enforcement, no bypass actors, deletion and force-push refused. Read back the effective ruleset. Public because GitHub offers required Environment reviewers on Free only for public repositories, the same reason as CP § 11. |
| Workflow | `dotmac-tech/lane3-exposure-execution/.github/workflows/lane3-exposure-rehearsal.yml@refs/heads/main` | `workflow_dispatch` only. No `pull_request`, `pull_request_target`, `workflow_call` or `push` trigger on the privileged job. Job-level condition requiring `workflow_dispatch` and `refs/heads/main`. Minimum `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions plus `id-token: write` on the protected job only. No third-party action on the privileged runner. |
| Environment | `lane3-rehearsal-protected` | Michael is the required reviewer. `main` only. Admin bypass disabled and read back. This is a one-person human gate, not two-person approval. |
| Runner group | `lane3-exposure-protected` | The full § 11 tuple: `allows_public_repositories=true`, `visibility=selected`, `selected_repository_ids=[<execution repository ID>]`, `restricted_to_workflows=true`, `selected_workflows=[<the ref-pinned workflow above>]`. Nothing else in the group. **Distinct from `gate0-issuer-protected`.** The two never share a group, a runner, a base image or an SSH CA, because Gate 0 is forbidden to connect to a target and Lane 3 exists to do exactly that. |
| Runners | Ephemeral, one job per runner | Registered just in time (`generate-jitconfig`) by a provisioner outside the public repository, on a VM recreated from a verified base image for every run. No persistent home directory, no credentials at rest, nothing carried between runs. Ephemerality is hygiene, not the selection control: selection comes from the group's repository and workflow restriction. |

**The launcher is thin.** It holds the dispatch grammar, the ordering in § 3,
and the evidence publication in § 5. Lane 3's behaviour stays in Starter: the
launcher checks out an exact Starter protected-`main` revision and runs that
revision's `exposure_rehearsal_runner.py` against the digest-verified
candidate wheel. Two copies of the runner would mean two contracts.

## 3. What one run does, in order

1. **Validate the dispatch inputs before anything else.** The inputs are
   `starter_revision` (exactly 40 lowercase hex characters),
   `candidate_version`, and an opaque Gate-3 grant reference. Anything else is
   refused. The grammar lives in one module that the launcher and the oracle
   (§ 6) both import, and a test proves it. `run-name` renders
   `lane3 starter=<starter_revision> candidate=<candidate_version>` from these
   inputs.
2. **Require the revision to be on Starter's protected `main`.** The compare
   API must report `main...<starter_revision>` as `identical` or `behind`. Any
   other answer, or no answer, refuses.
3. **Check out exactly that revision** and require `git rev-parse HEAD` to
   equal it. This verified checkout, not the launcher's own `GITHUB_SHA`, is
   the runner revision the receipt records as `foundation_revision`.
4. **Resolve, fetch and verify the candidate** from that checkout's committed
   `CandidateArtifact.v1`, and install the wheel in an isolated `-E -P`
   environment. This is unchanged from rule 44. The credential used to fetch
   the Starter artifact must be read-only and scoped to Starter. Whether a
   credential is needed at all for a public repository's artifact is
   **unmeasured**, and is measured during § 7.
5. **Verify the Gate-3 authorization** through `lane3_authorization.py` and
   Foundation's `ExecutionGrant`. If it does not verify, refuse before any
   OpenBao call.
6. **Fetch topology and credentials only now** (§ 4). Write each value to a
   `0600` file in a per-run tmpfs, pass file paths and never values on any
   command line, and add `::add-mask::` as defence in depth only.
7. **Execute, publish the redacted evidence (§ 5), and destroy** the keys,
   certificates and tmpfs. The runner then exits and its VM is destroyed.

**Honesty about step 5 → 6.** That order is enforced by reviewed workflow
code on protected `main`, not by a credential boundary. OpenBao sees the OIDC
claims of the workflow; it cannot see whether a Foundation grant verified.
Binding certificate issuance to a Control lease would turn this ordering into
a credential boundary. That is an **open item for Gate 3**, not a property
this design claims.

**Dispatch carries no topology.** The current `target`, `vm_slot`,
`controller_identity` and `authorization_run` free-text inputs go away.
`FoundationExecutionPlanV3` (ADR-0070, 2026-09-25) already binds the target
reference, Fleet `host_id` and controller fingerprint. The Proxmox slot is
topology, so it comes from the private record keyed by that `host_id`.

## 4. Private delivery

**Topology record.** One OpenBao KV v2 record, proposed path
`secret/dotmac/starter/lane3/vantage-topology`. It holds the probe vantage,
the inside vantage, the observer principal, the target → far-end mapping keyed
by Fleet `host_id`, the former private paths, and the slot map. Only Michael's
provisioning identity writes it. The workflow identity reads it and never
writes it. Receipts cite the record **version**, never its values.

**Topology record schema: `lane3.vantage-topology.v1`.** The record's `data`
is exactly this document. Every key is required, and no other key is
accepted at any level:

```json
{
  "schema": "lane3.vantage-topology.v1",
  "probe_vantage":  {"key": "<opaque key>", "host": "<external probe host>", "ssh_user": "<probe login>"},
  "inside_vantage": {"host": "<inside vantage>", "jump_principal": "<inside-vantage jump account>"},
  "observer_principal": "lane3obs",
  "targets": {"<Fleet host_id>": {"address": "<target address>", "far_end": "<target address>", "proxmox_slot": "<node/vmid>"}},
  "former_private_paths": ["<path>"],
  "probe_ports": [443]
}
```

- Every string is non-empty with no surrounding whitespace.
- `probe_vantage.key` contains no `@`, because receipts cite `probe_vantage_ref` as `<key>@<record version>`.
- `inside_vantage.jump_principal` equals the principal provisioned on `lane3-ssh/sign/inside-jump`, and is never `root`, `lane3obs` or Gate-0's `dotmac-gate0-controller`.
- `observer_principal` is exactly `lane3obs`.
- `targets` is a non-empty map keyed by the Fleet `host_id` bound in `FoundationExecutionPlanV3`.
- `targets.<host_id>.far_end` equals `address` exactly: the observation endpoint
  is the same target endpoint. Aliases or equivalent address spellings are not
  normalized. A mismatch refuses with a field-only error.
- `proxmox_slot` names the target's Proxmox slot as `node/vmid`, matching the
  existing runner's `--vm-slot` semantics. The parser treats it as a non-empty
  string; it does not verify Proxmox inventory.
- `former_private_paths` is a non-empty list of unique strings (the R6 input).
- `probe_ports` is a non-empty list of unique integers in 1–65535, the same list the inside vantage's `PermitOpen` uses.

`scripts/lane3_topology.py` is the parser (`parse_topology_record`). It
refuses the whole record on any deviation, and its refusal names the field,
never the value. B7's provisioning script must validate against the same rules
before a write (`tests/unit/test_lane3_topology.py` holds the parity fixtures).
The same-endpoint rule below requires a matching provisioning amendment;
this parser change does not update that private script.

**Same-endpoint amendment (2026-10-09).** `far_end` is the SSH endpoint on
which the restricted observer reads what the target saw. It is not a vantage
source address, a cached measurement, or a separate observing server. Source
IPv4 and IPv6 observations remain dynamic, measured at the target for each
required vantage and family on every run.

The parser enforces endpoint equality only. Fleet/lease identity reconciliation,
Proxmox inventory reconciliation and SSH host identity verification remain
provisioning/runtime obligations. D4's pending integration must select the
entry by the verified plan's Fleet `host_id`, use `far_end` for observation and
`address` for target transport, and refuse missing or mismatched bindings
before any target connection. This amendment does not implement that runtime
integration or establish admission. The private provisioning validator must
adopt the same equality rule before B7 writes the record.

**Consumption (D4, 2026-10-09).** `scripts/lane3_topology_source.py` is the one
seam through which Lane 3 code obtains the record. The reader is injected; the
production default (`RefusingKvTopologySource`) refuses as UNANSWERABLE until
B7 provisions the `lane3-exposure-rehearsal` role and the record, and no
fallback to repository variables, dispatch inputs or files exists. The dispatch
carries only the Fleet `host_id` (the `target` and `vm_slot` inputs are gone,
and `vars.LANE3_PROBE_HOST`/`INSIDE_VANTAGE`/`OBSERVER_USER` with them).
`lane3_rehearse.sh` resolves the record for its pre-runner steps through the
same seam, holding values in shell variables only. The runner reads the record
itself before the descriptor, refuses a KV version different from the one the
script resolved, and binds by `host_id`, then refuses unless the trusted plan's
`host_id` is the same host. `address` is the transport, `far_end` the
observation endpoint, the slot comes from the record, and `probe_vantage_ref`
is derived as `<probe_vantage.key>@<KV version>`. The terminal evidence carries
only `BoundTopology.evidence()`: record path, version, vantage reference,
counts and `host_id`. The real KV reader is not implemented here; it lands with
B7.

**Custody and evidence.** The values exist only in the OpenBao record (and
Michael's private input when he writes version 1). They never appear in Git,
dispatch inputs, logs, receipts or chat. Public evidence carries the KV
**version** and the value-free `structure()` summary (counts only). It never
carries a plain digest of the values: addresses are low-entropy, so a hash
can be inverted by brute force. If a content binding is ever required, it is
an HMAC keyed by an offline secret, decided separately.

**Consumer.** The D4 runner, inside the admitted launcher job, logs in with
the `lane3-exposure-rehearsal` JWT role (B7), reads this one record, parses it
with `parse_topology_record`, and holds it only in the run's memory and tmpfs.
Nothing in this repository reads OpenBao today. The parser is source-only
until D4's live integration is admitted.

**Workflow identity.** One OpenBao JWT role, proposed name
`lane3-exposure-rehearsal`, with `bound_claims` on `repository`,
`repository_id` and `repository_owner_id` (immutable IDs read at repository
creation), `environment`, `ref=refs/heads/main`, `workflow_ref` (the exact
coordinate in § 2) and `event_name=workflow_dispatch`, plus an exact
`bound_audiences` value (proposed `urn:dotmac:lane3:exposure-rehearsal`). The
token is short-lived and non-renewable. Non-renewability is checked on the
provisioned role, because a max TTL does not prove it. The policy permits only
reading the topology record and signing at the two Lane 3 roles below. It
explicitly denies `gate0-ssh/`, CP's issuer and attester signer paths, their
trust-state records, and everything else.

**Lane 3 SSH CA.** A dedicated mount, proposed `lane3-ssh/`, disjoint from
`gate0-ssh/` and holding a separate CA key. A Gate-0 certificate must never
authenticate to a Lane 3 host, and a Lane 3 certificate must never
authenticate to anything else. Key pairs are generated inside the run, and
private keys never leave the run's tmpfs.

| Role | Principal | Certificate constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lane3-ssh/sign/observer` | `lane3obs` (target-side, no sudo, no docker group, as today) | No PTY, no agent, X11 or port forwarding. TTL at most the job timeout, and the actual TTL is measured. |
| `lane3-ssh/sign/inside-jump` | the inside-vantage jump account | `force-command=/bin/false` and `permit-port-forwarding` only (`ssh -W` needs direct-tcpip and nothing else). Server-side `PermitOpen` limited to the declared probe ports. Same TTL rule. |

Each target and vantage trusts the Lane 3 CA through `TrustedUserCAKeys` and
an `AuthorizedPrincipalsFile`. The static `authorized_keys` entries are
removed in § 8.

**Controller identity** follows the per-run OpenSSH key pattern in CP spec § 5,
and the fingerprint is bound into the V3 plan. How the fingerprint is
presented to Control before the grant is issued is Gate-3 composition, owned
by CP, Control and Foundation. This document does not decide it. It only
retires the static `~/.dotmac/controller-*` file.

## 5. Public evidence without topology

**Rule:** no address, hostname, slot, jump detail or vantage value appears in
the execution repository's tracked files, variables, secrets, logs or
artifacts, or in a receipt. Masking is not the control, because it fails on
any transformed value. The control is that the value is never written to
public output.

- **Receipt identifiers become opaque.** `target` becomes the Fleet `host_id`,
  and `probe_identity` becomes the topology-record key and version. Every
  receipt also binds the run that produced it (execution `repository_id`,
  `run_id`, `run_attempt`), so a receipt cannot be moved from one run to
  another. **This is a Foundation contract change, and it must land in
  Foundation source before the Gate-2 freeze**, because the receipt contract
  ships inside the candidate bytes. Landing it later would spend the candidate
  (rule 48). Foundation owns the schema decision: an additive v1 field, or
  `RehearsalReceipt.v2`.
- **Raw probe evidence is encrypted.** It is bundled, encrypted to a recipient
  whose private key Michael holds outside every runner (proposed: `age`, with
  an offline key), and uploaded as the only raw-evidence artifact. The receipt
  binds the ciphertext's SHA-256, and each row's `evidence` points into bundle
  member paths. Item 16's requirement that a reader can confirm the vantage
  was inside the source set is met by a reader with record access resolving
  the record key and version. It is not met by publishing the address.
- **The generated status document** renders only opaque identifiers.

## 6. Oracle amendment (normative for D-S2)

The current oracle reads `exposure-rehearsal.yml` runs in the Starter
repository and treats the run's `head_sha` as the runner revision. Under this
topology, the run lives in another repository and its `head_sha` is the
launcher's commit. The amended oracle keeps every existing property: two
oracles, newest-then-check, fail closed on every ambiguity, no escape hatch.
It changes only where runs come from and how a run is tied to a Starter
revision.

**Pinned identity.** A checked-in `.github/lane3-execution.json` in Starter
holds:
- the execution repository name, `repository_id` and `owner_id`;
- the workflow path;
- the Environment name and ID, and the expected reviewer;
- the runner group name and ID;
- the admitted launcher revisions.

Changing any of these is a reviewed Starter PR. Placeholder values make the
oracle refuse (§ 9).

**Selection.** This replaces `gh run list --workflow exposure-rehearsal.yml
--commit <sha>` and `_fetch` against Starter.

1. List every run of the pinned workflow in the pinned repository with
   `event=workflow_dispatch` and `branch=main`, paginating to the end. An
   incomplete listing refuses.
2. Refuse if any listed run's `repository.id`, `path`, `event` or
   `head_branch` differs from the pinned values.
3. Parse each run's `display_title` with the shared grammar from § 3 step 1.
   A run whose title does not parse is excluded, and **only for this reason**:
   the launcher's first step refuses exactly that grammar before checkout, so
   such a run cannot have rehearsed any revision. D-S3 proves the grammar is
   shared and that the refusal is the launcher's first step. Without that
   proof, exclusion would be a masking path, and the oracle must refuse
   instead.
4. Keep the runs whose parsed `starter` equals the SHA under release. If none
   remain, refuse.
5. Select the newest by `(run_started_at, id)`, then require it to be
   `completed`/`success`. This is unchanged `decide` semantics.
6. **New checks.** The selected run's `head_sha` must be an admitted launcher
   revision. Its protected job's `runner_group_id` must equal the pinned group
   (jobs API). Its Environment approval must come from the expected reviewer
   on the pinned Environment ID (approvals API). Any read failure refuses.
7. Download the receipt from **exactly that run ID**, and apply
   `verify_publication` with the wanted revision set to the SHA under release.
   Require the receipt's run binding to equal the selected run's
   `(repository_id, run_id, run_attempt)`. Require the artifact digest as
   today.

The three-revision ancestry ruling in `release-facility.yml` is unchanged; its
runner revision is the receipt's `foundation_revision`. The read credential
for the execution repository's runs, jobs, approvals and artifacts must be
read-only. Whether the release job's own token can read them is measured in
§ 7. If it cannot, a read-only App installation scoped to the execution
repository is used, with no write permission.

**Rejected alternative.** An App posting a check run onto the Starter SHA from
the execution side. It would put a write credential with `checks: write` where
privileged code runs, and the receipt already binds the revision.

**Rule text follows code.** `AGENTS.md` rule 44's sentence "The workflow run's
`head_sha` remains the protected-main oracle" is amended in the same PR that
changes the oracle (D-S2), not before. Rules describe enforced behaviour.

## 7. Admission evidence before a privileged runner or credential

This mirrors CP § 11. A positive dispatch alone is never sufficient. On the
single ephemeral runner the order is fixed: the runner is shown idle, the
negative cases are queued and stay unassigned for the stated bound, and only
then does the protected positive dispatch run and get picked up.

| Check | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Public controls | Read back visibility, organization ownership, the ruleset, the Environment reviewer, branch policy and admin-bypass refusal, and the full runner-group tuple including the resolved repository ID. |
| Authorized scheduling | A Michael-approved dispatch from `main` reaches only the pinned group and protected job. The observed OIDC claims match the role. |
| PR exclusion | Same-repository and fork `pull_request` **and** `pull_request_target` probes, including probes that name the group or labels, never schedule on the group. |
| Ref and workflow failure | A non-`main` dispatch, a different workflow, a different ref and a reusable call never schedule and never obtain a token. A missing reviewer blocks the job. |
| Credential failure | Each wrong bound claim (name, immutable IDs, environment, ref, workflow, event, audience, expiry) is denied by the live role. The token cannot read Gate-0 or CP signer paths. |
| No-grant refusal | A dispatch without a verified grant makes no OpenBao request, which is observed on the OpenBao audit side. A log line saying so is not enough. |
| Isolation and disclosure | A failed or cancelled canary run leaves no key, certificate or workspace state, and the next run sees none. A private-side scan of the public logs and artifacts, using the topology record's actual values, finds none. The scan runs outside the public repository, because a public scan would need the values. |
| Oracle reachability | The amended oracle's reads (§ 6) succeed with the intended read credential and refuse with a wrong one. |

Scheduling probes use a disposable canary in the same group, on a separately
named and authorized isolated VM. The canary is neither the existing control
runner nor the shared testing server. Record repository IDs, read-backs, run
and job IDs, refusal outcomes and source revisions in the roadmap and the
canonical debt register.

## 8. Retiring the personal runner and static credentials

Lane 3 has never produced a receipt: qualification refuses before
`build_receipt`. The old path therefore has no working capability to preserve,
and retirement does not wait for org admission. It waits only for D-S2 to stop
any Starter workflow from targeting the label. Each step is evidenced by a
read-back, not by the change that was meant to cause it.

| Step | Action | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | **Split, 2026-10-06.** (a) `exposure-rehearsal.yml` is retired only after its rehearse-job steps move into a Starter-owned script that the launcher calls (D-S2c). 19 Starter guard test cases (measured 2026-10-06; § 13) encode its Lane 3 properties (candidate-bytes execution, `-E -P` isolation, authorization before probe, capability preflight). Deleting it first would leave those properties unguarded, because the launcher lives in another repository. (b) `control-runner-diagnostic.yml` is **held**: `packages/dotmac-runner-transport/EXTRACTION.toml` names VMID 124 (the control runner) as that programme's first adopter, and its cutover needs both repository diagnostics. Retiring it needs an owner decision on which plan wins. When R1 lands, it updates the executor inventory and lowers the `vars.LANE3_` ratchet to empty | Merge SHA. Executor-retirement ratchet green. |
| R2 | Deregister `control-runner-starter-mt`. **Held** with R1(b): same VMID 124 conflict | Starter runner listing reads zero runners, with a timestamp. |
| R3 | Destroy the runner VM and its disk, including the controller, observer, jump and probe keys at rest, and retire its Fleet declaration. **Held** with R1(b). The Lane 3 static keys can still be removed from the VM and from `authorized_keys` (R4) without destroying the VM | Hypervisor read-back of absence. Fleet record change. |
| R4 | Remove the static `lane3obs`, jump and probe-host keys from every `authorized_keys` they were installed in | Per-host read-back naming the host. "Unobserved" is recorded as unobserved, never as absent. |
| R5 | **Split:** deleting `LANE3_PROBE_HOST` can proceed; deleting and revoking `RUNNER_QUERY_TOKEN` is **held** with R1(b), because `control-runner-diagnostic.yml` uses it. Delete repository variable `LANE3_PROBE_HOST` and secret `RUNNER_QUERY_TOKEN`, and **revoke the underlying token at its issuer**, because deleting a repository secret revokes nothing | Variable and secret listings. Issuer-side revocation read-back. |
| R6 | **Done (source), 2026-10-06:** the private-address default is removed from `collect_probe_evidence.sh` (the value is now required from the private topology record), and the address ratchet is lowered to empty. Refreshing `lane3-acceptance-criteria.md`'s vantage references follows with the launcher | Merge SHA. |

## 9. Fail-closed contract for D-S2 and D-S3

Until § 7's evidence is recorded and `.github/lane3-execution.json` carries
non-placeholder IDs:
- the release oracle refuses with a named reason;
- the launcher workflow in the execution repository is refusal-only, like
  Gate-0's PR #1 (`f218660b`);
- no topology value is configured anywhere public.

D-S3 adds static guards with sensitivity proofs (planted violations turning
them red):
- no Starter or launcher workflow lets `pull_request*` select a self-hosted
  runner;
- no `vars.LANE3_*` topology and no topology literal in tracked files;
- the dispatch grammar is shared and its refusal is the launcher's first step;
- `Lane3RunnerCapability.v1` requires the private-delivery seam.

## 10. Who does what

| Work | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Create the organization repository, ruleset, Environment, runner group and JIT provisioner. Run the canary and its negative proofs | Michael |
| OpenBao JWT role and policy, `lane3-ssh/` CA and roles, the topology record, sshd CA trust on targets and vantages | Michael (provisioning identity only) |
| D-S2 launcher (refusal-only first) and oracle source. D-S3 guards. Retirement steps R1 and R6 | Starter |
| Receipt opaque identifiers and run binding, before the Gate-2 freeze | Foundation |
| How the controller fingerprint is presented to Control and the grant issued; binding certificate issuance to a lease | CP, Control and Foundation (Gate 3) |
| Lane 3 runner fixes (items 8, 12, 13–16 and far-end addresses) | D4, separate |

## 11. Decisions this document leaves to Michael

1. The final names of the repository, workflow, Environment, group, JWT role,
   SSH mount and topology record path.
2. The evidence encryption recipient and where its private key is held.
3. The oracle's read credential, if § 7 shows the release job's token cannot
   read the execution repository.
4. Where the JIT provisioner runs, and its owner.
5. Certificate and token TTLs, after measurement.

## 12. D4 scope: producing `RehearsalReceipt.v2` (added 2026-10-06)

D4 stays separate from Packet D (§ 10). This section fixes only its first
slice, so that a receipt the § 6 oracle reads has exactly one producer.

**Where it runs.** In the launcher's job in
`dotmac-tech/lane3-exposure-execution`, on an ephemeral runner in
`lane3-exposure-protected`, after `lane3-rehearsal-protected` is approved. The
producer is Starter execution tooling (`scripts/lane3_receipt_v2.py`), outside
Foundation `src/`. It costs the candidate nothing and moves the release
revision (roadmap freeze-boundary table, row 3).

**Inputs, and where each may come from.**

| Input | Source | Refused when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FoundationExecutionPlanV3`, `ExecutionGrant` | The trusted CP-rendered plan and `authorize_v3()` over an attested Control V2 pair | Always today: no provider and no verifier exist (`acquire_authority`, exit 2) |
| `DeploymentOutcome` | The public `Executor`, driven in-process under `deployment_lock` | Always today: host-source admission has no attesting provider (`execute_authorized_plan`, exit 2) |
| `ExecutionRunBindingV1` | The Actions runtime's repository, owner, run and attempt | The repository ID, owner ID, event, ref or workflow ref differ from `.github/lane3-execution.json` (exit 1) |
| The run, as the Actions API reports it | `GET .../actions/runs/{run_id}`, read by the launcher and passed as `--api-run` | Any of run ID, attempt, repository ID, owner ID, workflow path, branch, event or head SHA differs from the runtime or the topology, or the head SHA is not an admitted launcher revision (exit 1) |
| `probe_vantage_ref` | `<record-key>@<version>` of the private topology record | Not that grammar (an address or hostname does not parse) |
| `evidence_bundle_digest` | SHA-256 of the bundle as uploaded | The bundle is not `age`-encrypted (decision 9) |
| Results | The sixteen rows, each from its measuring phase | Any row missing or duplicated (`build_receipt_v2`) |

Neither witness is trusted. A job step can overwrite its own environment, and
the launcher's API document was fetched with a token the job holds, so a job
that can rewrite one can rewrite the other. Requiring them to agree turns an
accidental mismatch (a re-run attempt, a wrong ref, a step that edited one
variable) into a refusal here instead of at publication. **The binding
authority stays the oracle:** it selects the run by API with its own token, and
`require_execution_run` refuses a receipt naming any other run.

**Output.** The receipt's canonical bytes, written create-only after being
re-read by `RehearsalReceiptV2.from_json` and `require_execution_run`, the
oracle's own reader and check.

**Q1, answered 2026-10-06: yes, with conditions.** Items 1 and 8 can drive the
public `Executor` with no Foundation `src/` change:
`render_execution_plan` → V2 → V3, then `ExecutionBindings` → `authorize_v3`,
then `Executor(...)` under `deployment_lock` → `.run` / `.rollback`. The
conditions:

- **In-process only.** The CLI hard-codes `RefusingHostSourceAdmissionProvider`,
  and `Executor.run` verifies the host source first.
- **A Starter-owned `HostSourceAdmissionProvider`:**
  `scripts/lane3_host_source_admission.py` (`Lane3HostSourceAdmissionProvider`).
  It refuses today by delegating to Foundation's
  `RefusingHostSourceAdmissionProvider`, so it uses the same codes and has zero
  effects. The real implementation calls the public `admit_host_source` with:
  - the Gate-0 attester's candidate and installed `AttestationEnvelopeV2`
    pair, which binds the authorized wheel digest and what the target's
    interpreter loads;
  - an `AttestationVerifier` and `AttestationTrustPolicy` pinned to the
    attester key in Gate-0 trust state, never taken from job inputs;
  - the plan's `host_id`, the attested observation, and the package
    `dotmac-deployment-foundation`;
  - Control's `verification_context_digest` for this dispatch, and the
    current time.

  It cannot exist before Gate-0 steps A3–A5, which create the attester VM, its
  key and the trust state, nor before Control offers a context API.
- **Its own effects and runner.** The producer supplies its own `Effects` and
  `ExposureEffects`, and passes its own runner to `ComposeHostExposureEffects`.
  It never imports the CLI's private default runner.
- **A local mirror** of the CLI's private V3 plan rendering:
  `scripts/lane3_plan_v3.py`, built from public calls only.
  `tests/unit/test_lane3_plan_v3.py` proves the same canonical bytes and digest
  as `cli._render_local_execution_plan_v3`, and the same refusals. If parity
  ever breaks, the mirror follows the CLI, or Foundation exposes a public entry
  point before the Gate-2 freeze.

**Not in this slice.** A real admission provider, the Executor drive, the
OpenBao topology read, `lane3-ssh/` certificates, and moving
`exposure_rehearsal_runner.py` (still v1) onto the producer (§ 13). The
launcher calls the producer only after D-S2c.

## 13. D-S2c plan: one Starter-owned rehearsal script (planning only, 2026-10-06)

D-S2c is what lets R1a retire `exposure-rehearsal.yml` without leaving its
Lane 3 properties unguarded. This section plans it. **No workflow is deleted
by the PR that adds it.**

### Steps, in order

| # | Step | Where | Freeze-boundary cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Move the rehearse job's steps into `scripts/lane3_rehearse.sh`: capability check, candidate download and digest verification, isolated `python -E -P` install, authorization, probe collection, runner call, terminal-record write. `exposure-rehearsal.yml` then calls only that script, so its properties are asserted on the script | Starter | Execution tooling (row 3): no candidate cost; moves the release revision |
| C2 | Migrate `exposure_rehearsal_runner.py` from `build_receipt` (v1) onto the D4 producer: `assemble_receipt` with a plan, grant and outcome from `acquire_authority` and `execute_authorized_plan`. Item 9 becomes the v2 chain. The v1 path is removed in the same change, so nothing can publish a v1 receipt | Starter | Row 3; the receipt contract (#770) is already in candidate bytes, and nothing in Foundation `src/` changes |
| C3 | The launcher calls `scripts/lane3_rehearse.sh` at the dispatched Starter revision, and passes `--api-run` from its own API read. Its new commit is admitted in `.github/lane3-execution.json` with a checked-in launcher snapshot (below) | launcher repo, then Starter | Row 3; moves the **admitted launcher revision** |
| C4 | Admission evidence (§ 7, B5), then two distinct successful controller cycles through the launcher, as rule 45 requires before any retirement | live | None; it is evidence |
| C5 | **R1a:** delete `exposure-rehearsal.yml` and record its removal receipt. Set the `workflow:exposure-rehearsal` disposition in `docs/inventories/executor-retirement/dotmac_starter_mt.toml` to retired, lower `LANE3_VARIABLE_BASELINE` to empty, and retire or rehome the tests below | Starter | Row 3; moves the release revision, so it lands **before** the authoritative Gate-3 rehearsal, or the rehearsal is repeated after it |

C1 and C2 can land now: they are fail-closed and touch no host. C3 needs the
admitted launcher change. C4 needs B5 and Gate-0. C5 needs C4.

### Status: C1 and C2 implemented (2026-10-08, draft, stacked on #779)

- **C1.** `scripts/lane3_rehearse.sh` has two phases. `preflight` is the
  canonical capability check, alone. `rehearse` is, in order: resolve the
  facility; resolve the candidate (a closed-key reader of `resolve-candidate`);
  fetch; verify; isolated install; the authorization gate; the vantage
  qualification; the runner, under `-E -P`.
  - Each unit is marked `step "<name>"`, and the guards read the script unit
    by unit (`tests/architecture/lane3_rehearse_script.py`), dropping comment
    lines as bash does.
  - `exposure-rehearsal.yml` now runs `bash scripts/lane3_rehearse.sh
    preflight|rehearse` and keeps only what is a launcher property: checkout,
    setup, runner liveness, uploads, `id-token`, `runs-on`.
  - Dispatch inputs reach the script as **environment values**, no longer
    interpolated into `run:` bodies.
  - `vars.LANE3_` reads fell from 11 to 5, and the two-directional baseline is
    lowered in the same change.
- **C2.** The runner builds no v1 receipt (`build_receipt` is no longer
  imported).
  - It binds the execution run (pinned topology, runtime coordinates, the
    `--api-run` witness) **before the descriptor is opened**.
  - It takes the plan only from `lane3_receipt_v2.acquire_execution_plan`, and
    `establish_authorization` issues the grant against that plan.
  - It drives `execute_authorized_plan` at the transaction phase, and assembles
    with `assemble_receipt` from the encrypted `--evidence-bundle` and
    `--probe-vantage-ref`.
  - All of those refuse today. With the checked-in topology a run is
    UNANSWERABLE (exit 2) before the descriptor; with an admitted topology it is
    UNANSWERABLE at the plan, before the lease. D4 refusals map onto this
    lane's families through `receipt_v2_refusals`, with the call site choosing
    `PreconditionUnfit` (before the host) or `SpecError` (at assembly, under
    the lease).
- **Rehomed onto the script (10 cases):**
  - capability: canonical command, order before liveness, unconditional and
    pinned, and the upload's `--out`;
  - authorization: the gate's order, and the plan and grant source;
  - candidate artifact: execution, identity bites, and revision/isolation
    bites;
  - terminal release: the slot and candidate binding.

  New plant tests prove the script reader bites on a commented-out, masked or
  preceded capability check.
- **Still on the workflow until C3**, which brings the launcher snapshot: the
  preflight-job properties in `test_lane_three_runner_preflight.py`;
  `id-token: write`; and the `if: always()` terminal upload. The snapshot
  guards and the retirement of
  `test_the_rehearsal_job_still_targets_the_control_runner` belong to C3,
  because today the workflow still targets the control runner and no admitted
  launcher calls the script.

### The 19 dependent test cases, and where each goes

"Script" means the guard is re-pointed at `scripts/lane3_rehearse.sh` in C1.
"Launcher" means the property belongs to the launcher workflow. A launcher
property is guarded in Starter against a **checked-in snapshot** of the
admitted launcher workflow, whose digest is recorded beside its revision in
`.github/lane3-execution.json`. A launcher revision is admitted only if the
snapshot matches the launcher repository at that commit. The launcher's own
`source-policy` keeps its copy of each check.

| File | Cases | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test_exposure_rehearsal_requires_runner_capability.py` | 5 | Script: capability check unconditional, first, before runner liveness; record-upload shape. The two "both workflows" cases become script-plus-candidate-workflow |
| `test_lane_three_runner_preflight.py` | 5 | Launcher snapshot: hosted preflight, time bound, invokes the refusal, rehearsal depends on preflight. **Retired:** `test_the_rehearsal_job_still_targets_the_control_runner`, inverted by the runner-group check in `require_run_context` |
| `test_lane3_authorization.py` | 2 | Script: the authorization gate precedes probe and runner; no single V1 authority |
| `test_lane3_candidate_artifact_execution.py` | 3 | Script: digest-verified wheel, `-E -P` isolation, and the bite tests over identity, revision and isolation regressions |
| `test_lane3_terminal_release.py` | 3 | Launcher snapshot: `id-token: write` for workload identity; the terminal record uploaded under `if: always()`. Script: binding the run to a slot and candidate |
| `test_lane3_public_surface_guards.py` | 1 | `test_no_new_workflow_reads_lane3_topology_from_repository_variables`: its baseline is lowered to empty in C5 |

Not dependent, although the name matches:
- `test_lane3_execution_oracle.py` asserts `release-facility.yml` no longer
  lists runs of `exposure-rehearsal.yml`.
- `scripts/exposure-rehearsal/` fixture paths, and `exposure_rehearsal_runner`
  imports.

Also bound to the workflow: the executor-retirement inventory entry (C5) and
the self-hosted reachability guard, which keeps passing with one fewer
workflow.

### Ordering against the R holds

- **No conflict with C1–C5:** R1b (`control-runner-diagnostic.yml`), R2, R3
  and the token half of R5 are held on the VMID 124 decision
  (`dotmac-runner-transport`'s first adopter, hosting two runners).
- **C5 removes only the workflow.** Starter's runner service on VMID 124 (R3)
  and `RUNNER_QUERY_TOKEN` (R5) stay until that decision. Until then, the
  self-hosted reachability guard is what keeps the personal runner from being
  reached.
- **After C5, the personal runner has no Starter workflow left,** which is
  R3's precondition. The VM is never destroyed, because it hosts
  Observability's runner too.
- **Nothing here needs a Foundation `src/` change.** If C2 finds otherwise,
  that change moves before the Gate-2 freeze (row 1).

### B7 runtime reader preparation

`scripts/lane3_openbao_topology.py` implements the explicit JWT-to-KV reader.
The launcher calls `lane3_topology_source.openbao_source` with an authenticated
transport, a fresh JWT supplier and the approved exact KV version, then injects
that source into the resolver's `main(source=...)` or the runner's
`topology_src` parameter. Separate resolver/runner reads require fresh sources
with the same approved version. The factory does not select an endpoint,
credential, namespace or version from environment variables or dispatch input.
Unconfigured/default execution still refuses.

The reader requests the fixed B7 audience and role, accepts only a nonrenewable
batch token with the sole B7 policy and a measured lifetime of at most 300
seconds, then reads only the fixed topology record at the pinned version. It
refuses identity-policy additions, deleted/destroyed records, mismatched
versions and schema failures. There is no cached-success fallback or retry.
Tokens and JWTs are kept in process memory only; removal of Python references
is not a memory-zeroization guarantee. Batch tokens expire and cannot be
individually revoked. No root or custody credential is used.

The supplied transport uses verified HTTPS with an explicit CA file, no proxy
or redirect, bounded response size, per-socket timeout and a request shutdown
timer. It does not downgrade to HTTP. Existing private-tunnel HTTP deployments
need a separately reviewed authenticated transport adapter; this change does
not activate that path, provision B7, or establish live Gate-0 readiness.
Hosted CI owns tests of this repository; no local or named-host test run is
acceptance evidence for this reader.
