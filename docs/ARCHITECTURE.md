# Architecture

This expands the `CLAUDE.md` summary. See `docs/adr/0001-multi-tenant-architecture.md`
for the founding tenancy design and `docs/adr/0002-starter-consolidation.md`
for how this repo came to be the org's one starter.

## Layout

```
app/
  core/          config, db, models base (+ 6 cross-cutting models), security,
                 deps (route guards), middleware/, logging, errors, crud,
                 unit_of_work, features (manifest registry), audit
  features/
    tenants/     platform-level tenant provisioning (no tenant context)
    auth/        JWT login, sessions, /auth/me
    parties/     person + organization CRUD (/parties/people, /parties/organizations)
    rbac/        roles, role grants, audit-event read endpoint
  main.py        app assembly: middleware stack, error handlers, /health,
                 feature mounting
```

Core never imports `app/features` (import-linter contract). Features never
import each other (import-linter contract). Cross-feature references are
FK/UUID columns, never a Python import — e.g. `rbac`'s `PartyRole` refers
to `parties` via a composite FK, not by importing `app.features.parties`.

### Model placement: core vs. feature

`Tenant`, `TenantDomain`, `Party` (+ subtype tables `PartyPerson`/
`PartyOrganization`), `Role`, `PartyRole`, `AuthSession` live in
`app/core/models.py`; `AuditEvent` + `write_audit_event` live in
`app/core/audit.py`. These are the models `app.core.deps` (route guards) and
`app.core.middleware.tenant` (the resolver) query directly — and since core
cannot import features, anything core needs to query at runtime must live in
core. `Party` (spec amendment 2026-07-17) replaced the bare `Person` model —
it's the fleet-wide identity source of truth (`party_type` person|
organization), with profile data on the subtype tables. Everything not
needed outside its own feature stays feature-local: `UserCredential`
(password hashes) lives in `app/features/auth/models.py`, referencing
`parties`/`tenants` by string-form `ForeignKey`/`ForeignKeyConstraint` only.
See ADR-0002 for the full rationale — this is a deliberate deviation from
"one model per feature package."

## Request flow / middleware order

From `app/main.py`'s docstring, outermost to innermost as FastAPI executes
them (Starlette runs the *last-added* middleware first, so the add order in
the source is the reverse of execution order — the list below is execution
order):

1. **ObservabilityMiddleware** — assigns/propagates a request ID
   (`TRUST_INBOUND_REQUEST_ID` gates whether an inbound `X-Request-ID` is
   trusted or a fresh one is generated) and emits structured request logs.
2. **TrustedHostMiddleware** — only mounted when `TRUSTED_HOSTS` is set;
   drops requests to unrecognized `Host` headers before any tenant lookup.
3. **TenantResolverMiddleware** — resolves `request.state.tenant` from the
   `Host` header (see below) and sets it before any route runs.
4. **RateLimitMiddleware** — tenant/client-ip/path-keyed budget check.
5. **CSRFMiddleware** — double-submit cookie/header check for
   browser-cookie flows.

After middleware, `register_error_handlers(app)` installs the exception
handlers, `/health` is registered directly on `app`, and
`mount_features(...)` mounts each enabled feature's routers last.

### Health bypass

`/health` is a liveness check that must not touch the database (container
orchestrators probe it before a DB may even be reachable).
`TenantResolverMiddleware._HEALTH_PATHS` is a frozenset containing `/health`
and `/health/ready`; both are short-circuited before any tenant resolution
(no DB query at all). Today only `/health` is mounted as a route; `/health/ready`
is pre-listed for a future readiness endpoint and currently returns 404 at the
router after bypassing tenant resolution. `/health` is the only route in
`tests/architecture/test_route_guards.py::ALLOWLIST` permitted to carry zero
`require_*` guards. Every other route either carries a `require_*` dependency
or fails the architecture test.

## Tenant resolution

`TenantResolverMiddleware._resolve()`, in order:

1. **Custom domain** — exact match in `tenant_domains.domain` where
   `verified_at IS NOT NULL`, joined to an active, non-deleted `tenants` row.
2. **Subdomain** — `host` stripped of the `.` + `PLATFORM_ROOT_DOMAIN`
   suffix (rejecting nested subdomains) looked up against `tenants.slug`.
3. **Root domain** — `host == PLATFORM_ROOT_DOMAIN` → `request.state.tenant
   = None` (platform context; only `/platform/*` and `/health` are valid
   here — see `_is_platform_path`).
4. **Unknown host** — 404, except for platform paths and `/health`.

## The three-role DB model

Three Postgres roles, three connection URLs (`DATABASE_URL`,
`PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL`, `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`), created by the initial
Alembic migration (`alembic/versions/20260504_0001_initial_tenant_schema.py`):

- **`app_user`** (`DATABASE_URL`) — the FastAPI request-path role for
  tenant-scoped routes. RLS-enforced, cannot bypass. `app.core.db.get_db`
  runs `SELECT set_config('app.current_tenant', :id, true)` per request
  (transaction-scoped — the next pooled connection starts with no setting).
  RLS policies read that setting via `app_current_tenant_id()`, which
  treats unset/malformed values as `NULL`, so a forgotten tenant scope
  fails closed (zero rows) rather than leaking.
- **`platform_api`** (`PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL`) — used by `app.core.db.get_platform_db`
  for platform-wide routes (tenant provisioning). Explicit grants, **no**
  `BYPASSRLS`. Falls back to `DATABASE_URL` if unset (local dev only).
- **`app_admin`** (`MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`) — `BYPASSRLS`. Used only by
  `alembic upgrade` and `scripts/deploy.sh`'s pre-migration `pg_dump`
  backup — never by request-handling code. Migrations never run on
  container boot: the Dockerfile `CMD` only starts `uvicorn`;
  `scripts/deploy.sh` runs `alembic upgrade heads` as a one-off container
  step before recreating the app service.

Every tenant-scoped table gets `tenant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES
tenants(id)`, a composite unique for anything unique-per-tenant, and
`ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + a
`USING/WITH CHECK` policy on `tenant_id = app_current_tenant_id()`, applied
in the same migration that creates the table.

## Feature-mount sequence

1. `app/main.py` imports `FEATURE_MODULES` from `app/features/__init__.py`
   — a plain list of dotted module paths (currently `tenants`, `auth`,
   `parties`, `rbac`).
2. `app.core.features.load_manifests(FEATURE_MODULES)` imports each
   `<module>.feature` submodule via `importlib` (so core never statically
   imports `app.features`) and collects its `feature: FeatureManifest`
   (`name`, `routers`, `core: bool`, `enabled_by_default: bool`).
3. `app.core.features.mount_features(app, manifests=..., disabled=settings.disabled_feature_set)`
   mounts each manifest's routers via `app.include_router(...)`, skipping
   anything in `DISABLED_FEATURES` or with `enabled_by_default=False`.
4. Mount failures in a `core: True` feature re-raise (fails startup); a
   failure in a non-core feature is logged and skipped (fault isolation) —
   the app still boots without it.
5. `tests/architecture/test_feature_manifests.py` guarantees every package
   under `app/features/` on disk is registered in `FEATURE_MODULES` and that
   each manifest's `name` matches its package name — so a feature can never
   silently go unmounted or be mounted twice under a different name.

## Error handling

`app/core/exceptions.py` defines a `DomainError` hierarchy:
`NotFoundError` (404), `BadRequestError` (400), `ConflictError` (409),
`UnauthorizedError` (401), plus FastAPI's own `RequestValidationError`
(422) and an unhandled-exception catch-all (500). `app/core/errors.py`
maps every one of these to the same JSON envelope:

```json
{"code": "not_found", "message": "...", "details": null, "request_id": "..."}
```

`request_id` is pulled from `app.core.logging.request_id_var`, the same
context var `ObservabilityMiddleware` populates — so every error response
is correlatable with the structured request log line. Services raise
`DomainError` subclasses and let them bubble; routers never construct
`HTTPException` themselves for domain-level failures (see
`test_routers_do_not_issue_direct_queries` — routers stay thin; the
corollary is that error translation is centralized in `app/core/errors.py`,
not scattered per-router).

## Testing model

- **Unit** (`tests/unit/`, `tests/architecture/`) — in-memory SQLite, no
  network, no RLS. Fast; run with `make test-unit`. Covers CRUD/UoW/query
  helpers, error envelopes, feature registry, logging, tenant middleware
  logic, and the static architecture governance checks (thin routers,
  route guards, feature registration).
- **Integration** (`tests/*.py` at the top level —
  `test_cross_tenant_isolation.py`, `test_auth_tenant_claim.py`,
  `test_rbac_audit_isolation.py`, `test_security_middleware.py`) — require
  a real, migrated Postgres, because SQLite cannot enforce RLS. These are
  the tenancy canaries: two tenants, cross-tenant read/write attempts must
  come back empty/404. Run with `make test-db-up && make test-integration
  && make test-db-down` (disposable Postgres via `docker-compose.test.yml`,
  trust auth, localhost-only, throwaway). `TEST_DB_PORT` (and the other
  `TEST_DB_*` Make vars) are `?=`-overridable if the default port is taken.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — four jobs: `quality` (matrix over
  lint/lint-imports/type-check/security, `fail-fast: false`), `unit`
  (`tests/unit` + `tests/architecture` with coverage), `integration` (drives
  `docker-compose.test.yml` directly rather than a `services:` block,
  because the `env:` context isn't available there), and `docker-build`
  (builds the prod image, boots it with a deliberately unreachable
  `DATABASE_URL`, and health-gates `/health`).

## Deploy

`docker-compose.yml` (prod) requires a published `APP_IMAGE`, no bind
mounts, resource limits (`APP_MEM_LIMIT`, `APP_PIDS_LIMIT`), and a
container healthcheck against `/health`. `docker-compose.dev.yml` is an
overlay adding a local build + throwaway Postgres (`make docker-dev`).
`scripts/deploy.sh <tag>` is the only production migration path: verify
image on registry → `pg_dump` backup → pin `APP_IMAGE` in `.env` → pull →
`alembic upgrade heads` (one-off container) → recreate `app` → health gate
(retries/interval/timeout all config knobs) → auto-rollback to the previous
pin on health-gate failure (migrations are not auto-reverted; new revisions
must stay backward-compatible with the previous release).
