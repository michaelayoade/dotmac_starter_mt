# Architecture

This expands the `CLAUDE.md` summary. See `docs/adr/0001-multi-tenant-architecture.md`
for the founding tenancy design and `docs/adr/0002-starter-consolidation.md`
for how this repo came to be the org's one starter.

## Layout

```
app/
  core/          config, db, models base (+ 6 cross-cutting models), security,
                 deps (route guards), middleware/, logging, errors, crud,
                 unit_of_work, features (manifest registry), audit,
                 settings_models (DomainSetting), settings_resolver (spec
                 registry + tenant->platform->default resolver)
  features/
    tenants/       platform-level tenant provisioning (no tenant context)
    auth/          JWT login, sessions, /auth/me
    parties/       person + organization CRUD (/parties/people, /parties/organizations)
    rbac/          roles, role grants, audit-event read endpoint
    settings/      tenant settings admin API (spec declarations, seed, router)
    custom_fields/ field definitions CRUD + values on a registered entity's
                   custom_fields JSONB column (zero migrations per field)
  main.py        app assembly: middleware stack, error handlers, /health,
                 feature mounting
```

Core never imports `app/features` (import-linter contract). Features never
import each other (import-linter contract). Cross-feature references are
FK/UUID columns, never a Python import — e.g. `rbac`'s `PartyRole` refers
to `parties` via a composite FK, not by importing `app.features.parties`.

### Model placement: core vs. feature

`Tenant`, `TenantDomain`, `Party` (+ subtype tables `PartyPerson`/
`PartyOrganization`), `Role`, `PartyRole`, `AuthSession` live in
`app/core/models.py`; `AuditEvent` + `write_audit_event` live in
`app/core/audit.py`. These are the models `app.core.deps` (route guards) and
`app.core.middleware.tenant` (the resolver) query directly — and since core
cannot import features, anything core needs to query at runtime must live in
core. `Party` (spec amendment 2026-07-17) replaced the bare `Person` model —
it's the fleet-wide identity source of truth (`party_type` person|
organization), with profile data on the subtype tables. `DomainSetting`
(`app/core/settings_models.py`) and the spec registry + resolver
(`app/core/settings_resolver.py`) live in core for the same reason, one
level removed: the `custom_fields` feature must call `resolve_value`
directly (the per-entity field limit), and features may never import each
other, so the shared mechanics sit in core while the `settings` feature
keeps only what nothing else needs (spec declarations, seed, router,
schemas). `CustomFieldDefinition` stays feature-local
(`app/features/custom_fields/models.py`) — nothing outside `custom_fields`
touches it. Everything not needed outside its own feature stays
feature-local: `UserCredential` (password hashes) lives in
`app/features/auth/models.py`, referencing `parties`/`tenants` by
string-form `ForeignKey`/`ForeignKeyConstraint` only. See ADR-0002 for the
full rationale — this is a deliberate deviation from "one model per feature
package." The complete model-by-model list — owner and port source-of-truth
for every model class in the repo — is the **Model provenance table** below.

## Settings resolution order + platform-row RLS design

`domain_settings` (`app/core/settings_models.py::DomainSetting`) is keyed by
`(tenant_id, domain, key)` where `tenant_id` is **nullable**: a
`tenant_id IS NULL` row is a platform-level default, readable by every
tenant but writable only by the `platform_api` role. This is the one
tenant-scoped-ish table that deliberately does not follow the standard
"NOT NULL + single RLS policy" template (see the hard-rules exception noted
in `CLAUDE.md`):

- Two partial unique indexes stand in for one composite `UniqueConstraint`,
  because Postgres treats every `NULL` as distinct from every other `NULL` —
  a plain `UNIQUE(tenant_id, domain, key)` would let unlimited
  `tenant_id IS NULL` rows collide on `(domain, key)`:
  `uq_domain_settings_platform` (`tenant_id IS NULL`) and
  `uq_domain_settings_tenant` (`tenant_id IS NOT NULL`).
- RLS is a **split read/write policy pair**, not the single
  `USING/WITH CHECK` policy every other tenant-scoped table gets: `app_user`
  may `SELECT` a row where `tenant_id = app_current_tenant_id() OR
  tenant_id IS NULL` (own rows + platform defaults), but may only
  `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` where `tenant_id = app_current_tenant_id()` — never
  `NULL`. Only `platform_api` (no `BYPASSRLS`, but its own broader grants)
  writes `tenant_id IS NULL` rows. See
  `tests/test_settings_isolation.py` for the three load-bearing properties
  this buys: (a) a tenant-owned row is invisible cross-tenant, (b) a
  platform-default row is visible to every tenant, (c) a tenant session
  cannot smuggle a `tenant_id IS NULL`/other-tenant write past the policy.

**Resolution order** (`app.core.settings_resolver.resolve_with_source`,
`resolve_value` is a thin wrapper that drops the `source`): tenant row (if
`tenant_id` is not `None`) → platform row (`tenant_id IS NULL`) → the
`SettingSpec`'s own `default`. A stored value that fails coercion to the
spec's `value_type`, or violates `allowed`/`min_value`/`max_value`, degrades
all the way to the spec default (not to "ignore this row") — a corrupted
row can never break every caller. `source` (`"tenant" | "platform" |
"default"`) tells the settings admin API whether to mask a secret's value
(masked whenever a real row exists; never for the built-in default — there's
nothing to hide there).

**Spec registration**: `SettingSpec` instances are declared in a feature's
own module (today only `app/features/settings/spec.py`) and registered into
the core registry via `register_specs([...])` as an import-time side
effect — importing the `settings` feature package registers them. Nothing
enforces *where* a spec is declared beyond "some feature module, at import
time" — this is the extension point other features use to add their own
settings (see `CLAUDE.md`'s Extension points section). The
no-orphan-settings architecture test (`tests/architecture/
test_no_orphan_settings.py`) fails the build if a registered key's `key`
string never appears as a literal anywhere under `app/` outside the
`settings` package and the resolver module — a spec with no reader is a
dead control an admin could "change" with zero effect.

Write path: `PUT /settings/{domain}/{key}` → `settings/service.py::
update_setting` → `validate_spec_value` (raises `BadRequestError` on any
violation, never silently coerces on write — unlike the read-path
degradation above) → `settings_resolver.upsert_by_key` (always writes the
TENANT row; only a platform-role session can pass `tenant_id=None`) → an
audit event (`settings.update`, domain/key only — never the value, in case
it's a secret) written by the router, not the service.

## Party family + subtype RLS

`Party` (`app/core/models.py`) is the fleet-wide identity source of truth —
`party_type` discriminates `person`/`organization`. It carries the standard
tenant-scoped template (`tenant_id NOT NULL`, composite unique
`(tenant_id, id)`, a case-insensitive partial unique index
`(tenant_id, lower(email)) WHERE email IS NOT NULL`, single `USING/WITH
CHECK (tenant_id = app_current_tenant_id())` RLS policy) plus a
`custom_fields` JSONB column (default `{}`) that custom-fields values ride
on top of.

`PartyPerson`/`PartyOrganization` (1:1 subtype profile tables, PK = FK =
`party_id`) carry **no `tenant_id` column of their own** — isolation is
inherited entirely through the FK to `parties`, enforced by an
`EXISTS`-based RLS policy of the shape:

```sql
USING (EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM parties p
  WHERE p.id = party_persons.party_id
    AND p.tenant_id = app_current_tenant_id()
))
```

(see `alembic/versions/20260717_0003_party_identity.py` for the literal
policy on both subtype tables). `tests/test_party_isolation.py` is the
load-bearing proof this pattern actually holds — it's the pattern any
future subtype/detail table hanging off `parties` (or off any other
identity-shaped entity) should copy rather than adding its own `tenant_id`.

Auth credentials (`UserCredential`), RBAC grants (`PartyRole`), audit actors
(`AuditEvent.actor_party_id`), and auth sessions (`AuthSession`) all bind to
`party_id` — there is exactly one identity table for every feature to peg
to, replacing the old bare `Person` model (spec amendment 2026-07-17).

## Custom-fields value flow

Field **shape** (type, validation rules, display) is defined per-tenant in
`CustomFieldDefinition` (`app/features/custom_fields/models.py`) — a
standard tenant-scoped table (single RLS policy, same shape as `parties`).
Field **values** live on the entity's own row, in a `custom_fields` JSONB
column (e.g. `Party.custom_fields`) — riding on that row's *existing* RLS
policy rather than a separate values table with its own isolation to get
right.

The write path (`PUT /custom-fields/{entity_type}/{entity_id}/values` →
`service.py::set_values`) is **validate → merge → flag_modified**:

1. **Resolve** the entity row via `registry.resolve_entity(entity_type)` +
   `db.get(model, entity_id)` — `None` (including a cross-tenant row RLS
   hides) raises `NotFoundError`.
2. **Validate** (`validate_values`) every submitted key against that
   `entity_type`'s active `CustomFieldDefinition`s: required fields present,
   known field codes only (an unrecognized code is a caller-side error, not
   a silent drop — a deliberate gap-closure over the ERP port, see
   `service.py`'s module docstring), each value passing
   `CustomFieldDefinition.validate_value` (type-specific checks — BOOLEAN/
   DATE/DATETIME are strict, URL/PHONE/CURRENCY are documented passthrough
   pending a project-specific `validation_regex`). Any violation raises one
   `BadRequestError` joining every message — nothing is written on a
   partial failure.
3. **Merge** (partial-update semantics): `dict(row.custom_fields or {})`,
   then for each submitted key — `None` deletes the key, any other value
   overwrites it. Keys not present in the request are left untouched.
4. **`flag_modified(row, "custom_fields")`** — SQLAlchemy cannot detect an
   in-place mutation of a JSON/JSONB column's Python `dict` on its own;
   without this call the `UPDATE` never fires and the merged value is
   silently lost on flush. This is the load-bearing line in `set_values`.

This is also the **runtime-field / zero-migration** proof point: creating a
new field (`POST /custom-fields/definitions`) is a plain row insert against
an already-existing table — no Alembic migration, no deploy, no app
restart. `tests/test_custom_fields_isolation.py` plus the eye-color e2e
canary (`tests/unit/test_custom_fields_api.py`) demonstrate a field being
defined and used in the same test run with zero schema changes in between.

## Model provenance table

Every model class in `app/` (ORM `Base` subclasses — `grep -rn "class .*Base"
app/` to re-enumerate; excludes Pydantic `BaseModel`/`BaseSettings` schema
classes, which aren't persisted tables), its owner (`core` | the feature
package name), and its port source-of-truth. "native" means designed for
this repo, no upstream port. This is criterion 1 of the SOT-complete
criteria (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-starter-consolidation-design.md`)
made concrete — every model has exactly one declared owner.

| Model | Table | Owner | Port SoT |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Tenant` | `tenants` | core | native (dotmac_starter_mt, ADR-0001) |
| `TenantDomain` | `tenant_domains` | core | native (dotmac_starter_mt, ADR-0001) |
| `Party` | `parties` | core | native (spec amendment 2026-07-17; supersedes the earlier bare `Person`, which was `dotmac_starter`-derived) |
| `PartyPerson` | `party_persons` | core | native (spec amendment 2026-07-17) |
| `PartyOrganization` | `party_organizations` | core | native (spec amendment 2026-07-17) |
| `Role` | `roles` | core | dotmac_sub (`app/models/rbac.py`, tenant-adapted) |
| `PartyRole` | `party_roles` | core | dotmac_sub (`app/models/rbac.py::PersonRole`, tenant-adapted + renamed for Party) |
| `AuthSession` | `auth_sessions` | core | dotmac_sub (`app/models/auth.py`, tenant-adapted) |
| `AuditEvent` | `audit_events` | core | dotmac_sub (`app/models/audit.py`, tenant-adapted) |
| `DomainSetting` | `domain_settings` | core | dotmac_starter (`app/models/domain_settings.py`, tenant-adapted), with `CheckConstraint` restored from dotmac_sub |
| `UserCredential` | `user_credentials` | auth | dotmac_sub (`app/models/auth.py`, tenant-adapted) |
| `CustomFieldDefinition` | `custom_field_definitions` | custom_fields | dotmac_erp (`app/models/finance/automation/custom_field.py`, generalized: string `entity_type` registry instead of a finance-only enum, `tenant_id` instead of `organization_id`) |

`Party.custom_fields` and `DomainSetting`'s split-policy shape are
columns/behavior on the rows above, not separate tables, so they don't get
their own provenance row — they're called out in the sections above instead.

## Mutable-resource ownership list

SOT-complete criterion 1 ("every mutable resource, decision, and state
transition has one named owner") applied at the *resource* level, not just
the model level — one service-layer function (or, where two legitimately
exist, both named with the invariant that keeps them consistent) owns every
write:

| Resource | Owning write path(s) |
|---|---|
| Tenants | `app.features.tenants.service.create_tenant` (platform-only; no update/delete service yet) |
| Tenant domains | none — no write path exists yet (rows would be inserted by a future custom-domain feature) |
| Parties (person/org identity + profile) | **Dual writer**, see below: `app.features.parties.service.create_person_party` / `create_organization_party` (the `/parties` API), **and** `app.features.auth.service.register` (the `/auth/register` flow) |
| Party role grants | `app.features.rbac.service.assign_role` (API path) **and** `app.features.auth.service._assign_first_user_admin` (auto-assigns the tenant's first registered user the `admin` role — a second, narrower writer of the same table; see the RBAC follow-up in `docs/superpowers/phase2-backlog.md`) |
| Roles | `app.features.rbac.service.create_role`, and implicitly `_assign_first_user_admin` (creates the tenant's `admin` role on first use if it doesn't exist yet) |
| Auth credentials | `app.features.auth.service.register` (the only writer — no credential-update/password-reset path yet, phase 2c) |
| Auth sessions | `app.features.auth.service.login` (issues); no revoke/logout write path yet |
| Audit events | `app.core.audit.write_audit_event` — called from `rbac/router.py` and `settings/router.py` only; every audit-writing route calls this one function, never constructs `AuditEvent` directly |
| Domain settings rows | `app.core.settings_resolver.upsert_by_key` (tenant writes, via `settings/service.py::update_setting`) and `ensure_by_key` (platform-default seeding only, via `settings/seed.py::seed_platform_defaults`, idempotent — never overwrites an existing row) |
| Custom field definitions | `app.features.custom_fields.service.create_field` / `update_field` / `deactivate_field` (soft-delete only — no hard delete) |
| Custom field values | `app.features.custom_fields.service.set_values` (the only writer of any entity's `custom_fields` JSONB column) |

### Known dual-writer: Parties (auth register vs. parties service)

Two service functions independently construct a `Party` + `PartyPerson`
row: `auth/service.py::register` (the `/auth/register` self-service signup
flow, which also creates the `UserCredential` and first-admin role grant in
the same transaction) and `parties/service.py::create_person_party` /
`create_organization_party` (the tenant-admin `/parties` API, used to add a
party without a login). This is a **deliberate, not accidental** dual
writer — one flow is "a person signs themselves up," the other is "an admin
adds a contact/customer record" — flagged here per SOT-complete honesty
rather than silently left implicit.

The shared invariant both writers must preserve, by hand, in both places:

- **Email is lowercased at the write boundary.** `auth/service.py::register`
  calls `payload.email.lower()` once and reuses that value for `Party.email`,
  `UserCredential.email`, and the returned view; `parties/service.py::
  create_person_party`/`create_organization_party` do the same
  (`payload.email.lower()`) independently. Both must agree because the
  `parties` table's uniqueness index is `lower(email)`-based — a
  mixed-case write from either path that skipped normalization would still
  be rejected by the DB constraint, but a *read*-side comparison
  (credential lookup at login) that skipped it would silently fail to
  match. There is no shared helper enforcing this today — a new writer of
  `Party.email` must replicate the `.lower()` call, not assume it.
- **`display_name` derivation.** Both writers compute
  `f"{first_name} {last_name}"` (person) / `legal_name` (organization) and
  write it once at create time; there is no update path for either writer
  today, so no drift-repair function exists yet. This is the specific
  known gap already tracked in `docs/superpowers/phase2-backlog.md`
  ("SOT-complete gaps") — when an update endpoint lands, `display_name`
  needs either a single write-owner + idempotent repair, or must become
  computed-at-read instead of stored.

## Request flow / middleware order

From `app/main.py`'s docstring, outermost to innermost as FastAPI executes
them (Starlette runs the *last-added* middleware first, so the add order in
the source is the reverse of execution order — the list below is execution
order):

1. **ObservabilityMiddleware** — assigns/propagates a request ID
   (`TRUST_INBOUND_REQUEST_ID` gates whether an inbound `X-Request-ID` is
   trusted or a fresh one is generated) and emits structured request logs.
2. **TrustedHostMiddleware** — only mounted when `TRUSTED_HOSTS` is set;
   drops requests to unrecognized `Host` headers before any tenant lookup.
3. **TenantResolverMiddleware** — resolves `request.state.tenant` from the
   `Host` header (see below) and sets it before any route runs.
4. **RateLimitMiddleware** — tenant/client-ip/path-keyed budget check.
5. **CSRFMiddleware** — double-submit cookie/header check for
   browser-cookie flows.

After middleware, `register_error_handlers(app)` installs the exception
handlers, `/health` is registered directly on `app`, and
`mount_features(...)` mounts each enabled feature's routers last.

### Health bypass

`/health` is a liveness check that must not touch the database (container
orchestrators probe it before a DB may even be reachable).
`TenantResolverMiddleware._HEALTH_PATHS` is a frozenset containing `/health`
and `/health/ready`; both are short-circuited before any tenant resolution
(no DB query at all). Today only `/health` is mounted as a route; `/health/ready`
is pre-listed for a future readiness endpoint and currently returns 404 at the
router after bypassing tenant resolution. `/health` is the only route in
`tests/architecture/test_route_guards.py::ALLOWLIST` permitted to carry zero
`require_*` guards. Every other route either carries a `require_*` dependency
or fails the architecture test.

## Tenant resolution

`TenantResolverMiddleware._resolve()`, in order:

1. **Custom domain** — exact match in `tenant_domains.domain` where
   `verified_at IS NOT NULL`, joined to an active, non-deleted `tenants` row.
2. **Subdomain** — `host` stripped of the `.` + `PLATFORM_ROOT_DOMAIN`
   suffix (rejecting nested subdomains) looked up against `tenants.slug`.
3. **Root domain** — `host == PLATFORM_ROOT_DOMAIN` → `request.state.tenant
   = None` (platform context; only `/platform/*` and `/health` are valid
   here — see `_is_platform_path`).
4. **Unknown host** — 404, except for platform paths and `/health`.

## The three-role DB model

Three Postgres roles, three connection URLs (`DATABASE_URL`,
`PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL`, `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`), created by the initial
Alembic migration (`alembic/versions/20260504_0001_initial_tenant_schema.py`):

- **`app_user`** (`DATABASE_URL`) — the FastAPI request-path role for
  tenant-scoped routes. RLS-enforced, cannot bypass. `app.core.db.get_db`
  runs `SELECT set_config('app.current_tenant', :id, true)` per request
  (transaction-scoped — the next pooled connection starts with no setting).
  RLS policies read that setting via `app_current_tenant_id()`, which
  treats unset/malformed values as `NULL`, so a forgotten tenant scope
  fails closed (zero rows) rather than leaking.
- **`platform_api`** (`PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL`) — used by `app.core.db.get_platform_db`
  for platform-wide routes (tenant provisioning). Explicit grants, **no**
  `BYPASSRLS`. Falls back to `DATABASE_URL` if unset (local dev only).
- **`app_admin`** (`MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`) — `BYPASSRLS`. Used only by
  `alembic upgrade` and `scripts/deploy.sh`'s pre-migration `pg_dump`
  backup — never by request-handling code. Migrations never run on
  container boot: the Dockerfile `CMD` only starts `uvicorn`;
  `scripts/deploy.sh` runs `alembic upgrade heads` as a one-off container
  step before recreating the app service.

Every tenant-scoped table gets `tenant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES
tenants(id)`, a composite unique for anything unique-per-tenant, and
`ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + a
`USING/WITH CHECK` policy on `tenant_id = app_current_tenant_id()`, applied
in the same migration that creates the table.

## Feature-mount sequence

1. `app/main.py` imports `FEATURE_MODULES` from `app/features/__init__.py`
   — a plain list of dotted module paths (currently `tenants`, `auth`,
   `parties`, `rbac`, `settings`, `custom_fields`).
2. `app.core.features.load_manifests(FEATURE_MODULES)` imports each
   `<module>.feature` submodule via `importlib` (so core never statically
   imports `app.features`) and collects its `feature: FeatureManifest`
   (`name`, `routers`, `core: bool`, `enabled_by_default: bool`).
3. `app.core.features.mount_features(app, manifests=..., disabled=settings.disabled_feature_set)`
   mounts each manifest's routers via `app.include_router(...)`, skipping
   anything in `DISABLED_FEATURES` or with `enabled_by_default=False`.
4. Mount failures in a `core: True` feature re-raise (fails startup); a
   failure in a non-core feature is logged and skipped (fault isolation) —
   the app still boots without it.
5. `tests/architecture/test_feature_manifests.py` guarantees every package
   under `app/features/` on disk is registered in `FEATURE_MODULES` and that
   each manifest's `name` matches its package name — so a feature can never
   silently go unmounted or be mounted twice under a different name.

## Error handling

`app/core/exceptions.py` defines a `DomainError` hierarchy:
`NotFoundError` (404), `BadRequestError` (400), `ConflictError` (409),
`UnauthorizedError` (401), plus FastAPI's own `RequestValidationError`
(422) and an unhandled-exception catch-all (500). `app/core/errors.py`
maps every one of these to the same JSON envelope:

```json
{"code": "not_found", "message": "...", "details": null, "request_id": "..."}
```

`request_id` is pulled from `app.core.logging.request_id_var`, the same
context var `ObservabilityMiddleware` populates — so every error response
is correlatable with the structured request log line. Services raise
`DomainError` subclasses and let them bubble; routers never construct
`HTTPException` themselves for domain-level failures (see
`test_routers_do_not_issue_direct_queries` — routers stay thin; the
corollary is that error translation is centralized in `app/core/errors.py`,
not scattered per-router).

## Testing model

- **Unit** (`tests/unit/`, `tests/architecture/`) — in-memory SQLite, no
  network, no RLS. Fast; run with `make test-unit`. Covers CRUD/UoW/query
  helpers, error envelopes, feature registry, logging, tenant middleware
  logic, and the static architecture governance checks (thin routers,
  route guards, feature registration).
- **Integration** (`tests/*.py` at the top level —
  `test_cross_tenant_isolation.py`, `test_auth_tenant_claim.py`,
  `test_rbac_audit_isolation.py`, `test_security_middleware.py`,
  `test_party_isolation.py`, `test_settings_isolation.py`,
  `test_custom_fields_isolation.py`) — require a real, migrated Postgres,
  because SQLite cannot enforce RLS. These are the tenancy canaries: two
  tenants, cross-tenant read/write attempts must come back empty/404. Run
  with `make test-db-up && make test-integration && make test-db-down`
  (disposable Postgres via `docker-compose.test.yml`, trust auth,
  localhost-only, throwaway). `TEST_DB_PORT` (and the other `TEST_DB_*`
  Make vars) are `?=`-overridable if the default port is taken.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — four jobs: `quality` (matrix over
  lint/lint-imports/type-check/security, `fail-fast: false`), `unit`
  (`tests/unit` + `tests/architecture` with coverage), `integration` (drives
  `docker-compose.test.yml` directly rather than a `services:` block,
  because the `env:` context isn't available there), and `docker-build`
  (builds the prod image, boots it with a deliberately unreachable
  `DATABASE_URL`, and health-gates `/health`).

## Deploy

`docker-compose.yml` (prod) requires a published `APP_IMAGE`, no bind
mounts, resource limits (`APP_MEM_LIMIT`, `APP_PIDS_LIMIT`), and a
container healthcheck against `/health`. `docker-compose.dev.yml` is an
overlay adding a local build + throwaway Postgres (`make docker-dev`).
`scripts/deploy.sh <tag>` is the only production migration path: verify
image on registry → `pg_dump` backup → pin `APP_IMAGE` in `.env` → pull →
`alembic upgrade heads` (one-off container) → recreate `app` → health gate
(retries/interval/timeout all config knobs) → auto-rollback to the previous
pin on health-gate failure (migrations are not auto-reverted; new revisions
must stay backward-compatible with the previous release).
