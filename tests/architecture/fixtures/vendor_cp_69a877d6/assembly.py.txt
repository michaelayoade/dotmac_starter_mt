"""The vendor `ProductAssemblySpec` — how this product composes the kernel.

`build_spec()` declares the vendor control plane as a `dotmac_kernel.assembly.
ProductAssemblySpec` and `main.py` boots it via `dotmac_kernel.create_app`. The
kernel provides config, the single RLS database, platform-admin auth, middleware,
and feature mounting; the vendor supplies only its own feature modules. No copied
kernel code, no private kernel imports (deny-case D5).
