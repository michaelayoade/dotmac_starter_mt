"""Compose the vendor migration lineage with the kernel's shipped base lineage.

The vendor control-plane database runs the KERNEL base migrations (shipped as
`dotmac_kernel` package data, located via the public `versions_dir()`), the
installed Release Catalog, Entitlement Allocation, Approvals, Commercial
Agreements, Licensing and Deployment Control module lineages, PLUS this repo's
own `alembic/versions` — one revision graph, eight separately-owned lineages.
Because all shared packages are installed dependencies (not fixed repo paths),
`version_locations` is composed programmatically rather than hard-coded in
`alembic.ini`.

Import-safe: builds an Alembic `Config` only — it constructs no engine (deny-case
D1) and imports only the kernel's PUBLIC `migrations` surface (deny-case D5).
