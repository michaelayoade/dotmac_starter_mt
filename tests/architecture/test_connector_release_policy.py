"""A connector may be released only after it has proved it conforms.

The third release lane, and the one whose subject is discovered rather than
called. `.github/release-connectors.json` is the policy;
`scripts/release_connector.py` is the gate that fails closed on it; this file is
the proof the gate bites, because a gate nobody has driven with a violation is
an assertion about a file.

Three layers, as in the module and adapter lanes, and each fails differently:

1. `release_connector.py resolve` refuses an unlisted distribution, an entry
   carrying stateful facts, an incomplete entry, and — the check this lane adds
   — a floor no installer can resolve.
2. `conformance` checks statically what can be checked before installation.
3. `verify-wheel` runs the shipped SPI kit against the INSTALLED bytes.

The lane contains one connector. Synthetic entries still drive each refusal so
the gate cannot rot into a check that merely recognises today's package, while
the real entry has its own resolution and wheel-policy proofs.

**The classification is a shared floor, not the separator.** A connector's
`EXTRACTION.toml` declares `stateless-protocol-adapter` — the same as an
adapter's, because the four properties that classification governs are exactly
the four a connector has, and `connector-plugin` is the name of a release
PROFILE rather than a fourth ADR-0006 classification. So the classification
check cannot be what keeps a connector out of the adapter lane or an adapter out
of this one. What does that work is the strictness this lane adds, and
`test_a_real_adapter_with_the_same_classification_is_still_refused` is the proof
— it drives the gate with `dotmac-auth-oidc`, a genuine
`stateless-protocol-adapter` in the tree, and requires a refusal.

    excuses it; and declaring `0.1.0a4` re-opens the gap. Neither state is the

    The invariant is the one the lane enforces: **the declared version is not
    automatically a usable floor.** A connector author reading
    `pyproject.toml` or `docs/MODULE_CATALOG.md` sees the declared number, and
    naming it as `integration_floor` produces an unresolvable wheel whenever it
    has not been tagged. So the two facts are asserted to AGREE, rather than
