"""One capability id, two connectors, and no published contract between them.

ADR-0024 § 8.1 says a capability id is one contract with one payload, and § 8.4
records that two shipped capability families had each grown two dialects with no
gate able to see it. §§ 10-12 built the gate: the owning DOMAIN publishes the
schema, a connector may only claim its digest, and four seams enforce it.

The gate does not, by itself, repair anything already shipped. Every capability
in the fleet is in a declared `SchemaGrace` on the day it lands, and § 11.2 is
explicit that `messaging.send.v1` is repaired by SUCCESSION — new ids — rather
than by redefining a published version. So the shipped divergence stays for a
bounded window, and the question this file answers is the one ADR-0032 asks of
any gap: is it OBSERVED, or merely unnoticed?

This is the observation. It reads every connector distribution in this
repository, computes which capability ids are implemented by more than one of
them, and holds that register against a named, reviewed expectation. It is a
TWO-DIRECTIONAL ratchet: adding a second implementation of a capability without
recording it fails, and so does removing one without lowering the register —
because a silently shrinking backlog is how a gap stops being tracked while
still existing somewhere else.

Nothing here asserts the divergence is acceptable. It asserts that it is
enumerable, attributed, and cannot grow unnoticed.

#: `messaging.send.v1` is the one ADR-0024 § 8.4 documents in full:
#: `meta_whatsapp` takes `send_text | send_template | send_media` with a
#: `recipient` parameter, `meta_social` takes
#: `send_direct_message | reply_to_comment` with `recipient_id` plus `channel`.
#: Two disjoint command vocabularies behind one id. § 11.2 rules that it is
#: repaired by SUCCESSION — `messaging.direct.send.v2`,
#: `social.comment.reply.v1` and `social.profile.read.v1` — and NOT by
#: redefining v1, which is why this entry is expected to persist until Sub has
#: migrated and v1 is retired, rather than to disappear in the change that
#: built the gate.
#:
#: The payments rows are § 8.4's other family, and ADR-0061 A3 answers them the
#: same way: the payload question is decided ONCE by the domain contract and
#: each connector adapts internally.
