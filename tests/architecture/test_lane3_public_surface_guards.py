"""Two guards on what this PUBLIC repository's execution tooling may contain.

Part of Lane 3's move to an organization execution surface
(``docs/LANE3_EXECUTION_TOPOLOGY.md``, D-S3). Both are stated with their limits,
because an implied guard is worse than an honest unmonitored region (ADR-0018).

**1. No self-hosted job on ``main`` is reachable from anything but a manual
dispatch of ``main``.** A ``pull_request_target`` job runs with base-repository
context for a fork's pull request; a ``push`` or ``workflow_call`` job runs for
whatever pushed or called it. On a self-hosted runner, each of those is code
the runner owner did not choose. What this does NOT do: stop a branch from
ADDING a workflow that selects the label, or dispatching a modified copy of one.
A label routes jobs and restricts nothing, which is precisely why Lane 3 moves
to an organization runner group restricted to one ref-pinned workflow. This
guard keeps ``main``'s own workflows from being the hole.

**2. No topology in the tooling.** Execution tooling (``scripts/`` and
``.github/workflows/``) carries no IP literal other than loopback, unspecified
and the documentation ranges (RFC 5737, RFC 3849), and no NEW repository
variable feeding Lane 3 topology. Exceptions are ratcheted in both directions.
R6 lowered the address baseline to empty; R1 lowers the `vars.LANE3_` baseline
when the retiring workflow goes. Scope stops at tooling:
``docs/inventories/`` carries dated measurement records, whose estate
addresses were redacted on 2026-10-05 (the role → address map is held
privately). This guard does not scan docs, so a new address there would not be
caught here.
