"""A migration that shipped in a published tag is history, and history is bytes.

## The enforceable premise (ADR-0018)

Every migration file present at any tag recorded below is inside a wheel on the
registry, and has therefore RUN, unmodified, in at least one database this
repository does not own and cannot inspect. The owner and tag counts are
derived by the guards; prose does not freeze a census that becomes false with
the next release.

Allocation is the sharper case, and the reason the guard grew a second
distribution rather than staying a one-module special. Its first four releases
hold ONE migration with ONE digest: a2 exposed `versions_dir()`, a3 made the ORM
relationships class-bound, a4 moved a manifest declaration between plane slots.
a6 then shipped the two prerequisite verifier revisions after deliberately
skipping a5. A quiet directory is not evidence its released bytes remain ours.

The integration a3 entry was added while #204 was open: a3 was tagged from `b14f66e`
after the branch was cut, which is exactly the event the map has to absorb
rather than be surprised by. The six files did not move — a3 is a Python fix —
so the entry repeats a2's digests, and
`test_two_tags_agree_unless_the_divergence_is_exactly_grandfathered` is what
proves that repetition is a fact rather than a paste.

Editing such a file does not migrate anything. It changes what a future
installation builds while every existing installation keeps whatever the old
bytes built — and `alembic_version` records only that the revision ran, never
which version of it. So the divergence is permanent, silent, and invisible to
every other gate here: the composed gate reads the CURRENT tree, the
live-catalog gate reads a database built from the CURRENT tree, and both agree
with each other while disagreeing with the field.

That premise is enforceable, which is what makes this a guard rather than a
convention. "Released" is not a judgement call: it is a tag on `origin`, and
every digest below is reproducible with

    git show <tag>:<path> | shasum -a 256

## Two halves, because either alone is defeatable

The **checked-in map** is what a reviewer reads: an edit to a released
migration shows up as a digest change in the diff, at the moment somebody could
still object. On its own it is defeatable in one commit — edit the file, update
the digest beside it, and the comparison agrees with itself.

So the map is also **cross-checked against the tags**: every recorded digest
must equal the SHA-256 of the blob git holds at that tag. Doctoring the map now
requires moving a tag on `origin`, which is a different and far more visible
act. Neither half is redundant; the first catches the honest mistake, the
second catches the map being brought into line with it.

The tag half follows the fail-closed oracle discipline #202 established for
`test_declared_publication.py`: a shallow or tagless checkout is a FAILURE, not
a skip, because "the oracle was unavailable" is never evidence that nothing is
wrong. It is runnable because that change gave the `unit` job `fetch-depth: 0`
— before it, this half would have been permanently skipped, which is why the
checked-in map is the primary and not merely a convenience.

## What this does NOT claim

It does not stop a released migration from being WRONG. A defect in shipped DDL
is repaired by a new revision that alters the result — the same discipline as
`ig_0007`, which verifies a prerequisite `ig_0001` should arguably have verified
and does not touch `ig_0001` to do it. This guard only insists the repair be
additive.

Approvals and ticketing are the measured exceptions to one-byte-history.
`ap_0001` shipped three byte sets across a1-a4 before enrolment; `tk_0001`
shipped two across a3-a4, and that second one was found by ENROLLING the
lineage on 2026-09-01 rather than by any gate — it is the same in-place edit
approvals made in the same week, invisible only because nothing was pointed at
it. `GRANDFATHERED_DIVERGENCES` records each closed historical set and the
canonical bytes retained by the tree; it is not permission for another edit.

The approvals census is paired with
`tests/test_approvals_released_migration_upgrades.py`, which reconstructs each
tagged meaning and proves its additive upgrade on PostgreSQL. Ticketing has no
such matrix, deliberately: it is sequenced AFTER the additive `tk_0002` repair
exists, because the matrix's job is to prove that repair. Its inventory says so
rather than implying evidence exists — and records that a straight port of the
approvals matrix would not do the job, because that matrix asserts tables and
rows and never asserts a grant.

## The kernel

``dotmac-kernel`` was the largest hole this file had, and the last one anybody
would have expected to find open: 61 published tags, 28 migrations, and a pin
in every product in the fleet. It stayed uncovered because the census below
read ``.github/release-modules.json`` alone, and the kernel is deliberately
absent from that allowlist — it has its own workflow with its own inspection
rules. "Not in the module allowlist" was therefore doing double duty: it meant
*unreleasable* for a package with no lane, and *released by a different lane*
for this one. ``_publishable_here`` separates them by reusing the sweep's own
``DEDICATED_WORKFLOWS``, and the dedicated-lane published-tag proof below
keeps that second door from becoming a way in for a name no tag supports.

## Scope

Every distribution named in ``DISTRIBUTIONS``. Each entry's digests were read
from its published tags when that lineage enrolled. That is the enrolment rule,
and it is the reason this is still not generalised to "every allowlisted
module": a distribution enters when the tag oracle has actually verified its
history, because a guard populated by guesswork is worse than an absent one.

Enrolment is therefore a data edit — a row in `DISTRIBUTIONS`, its tags in
`RELEASED_TAGS`, and its still-editable files in `UNRELEASED`. The
`test_every_migration_is_either_released_or_declared_unreleased` ratchet then
holds that distribution's whole versions directory, in both directions.

An unenrolled distribution is UNMONITORED here, not exempt (ADR-0018). The
difference is visible in `test_the_unmonitored_distributions_are_named`, which
lists exactly which allowlisted modules this file says nothing about.

    # Four tags, one migration, one digest. `ea_0001` has not moved a byte
    # since `0.1.0a1`: a2 exposed `versions_dir()`, a3 made the ORM
    # relationships class-bound, and a4 moved the tables from the `tables=`
    # slot to `platform_tables=` — all three are Python-only, and the fourth
    # changed a manifest declaration rather than any DDL.
    #
    # That is exactly the history that makes an in-place edit tempting: four
    # releases with nothing to show for them in this directory reads as "the
    # migration is still ours". It is not — those bytes have run in databases
    # this repository does not own, which is why `ea_0002` exists as its own
    # head instead of a `require_prerequisites` line appended to `ea_0001`.

#: The accepted released-byte divergences. Each records damage already in the

#: latest shipped shape and is the only byte set the current tree may retain.
#:
#: Two rows, and the second is the reason the first was never enough. Approvals
#: and ticketing made the SAME edit to their lineage roots in the same week --
#: implicit plane inference rewritten into ADR-0028 explicit selection, in
#: place, on a published revision. Approvals was enrolled here, so it was
#: caught, written up and given a PostgreSQL upgrade matrix
#: (`tests/test_approvals_released_migration_upgrades.py`). Ticketing was not
#: enrolled, so the identical edit passed every gate and was found only when
#: this lineage was enrolled on 2026-09-01. That asymmetry is the argument for
#: closing the coverage baseline; it is not an argument that one edit was worse.
#:
#: Every row must be written up under `docs/inventories/`, which
#: `test_every_grandfathered_divergence_is_written_up` enforces -- a divergence
