"""The DESIGN's own evidence, kept honest — not the contract's implementation.

`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-foundation-concern-contribution-contract.md`
is a proposal. It carries golden byte fixtures, and a golden fixture nobody
re-derives is a decoration — which is precisely the inert shape the design it
supports is written about. So the fixture is re-derived here from the SHIPPED
canonicalizer.

**This file guards the fixture. It does not implement the contract.** There is
no build tool here, no discovery, no module declaration and no entry-point
group. When item 7 lands, its tests are elsewhere and these stay.

The document itself is asserted only where a claim in it is checkable against
this repository. Prose is not tested — a detector that matched its own docstring
is a defect this package has already shipped once — but a NUMBER in a review
package that no longer holds is a false statement in the artifact a decision
gets made from.
