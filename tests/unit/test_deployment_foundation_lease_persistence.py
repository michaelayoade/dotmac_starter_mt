"""Lease persistence: the terminal release lives BESIDE the lease, in one store.

## Why one store rather than two

A release written anywhere else is a second ledger, and the destroy gate would
then consult one record while the lease lived in another — which is exactly how a
swapped lease goes unnoticed. `release_path` is derived from `_lease_path` rather
than composed independently, so the two records cannot drift apart.

## The gate is only meaningful once a release can exist

`require_release_before_destruction` has refused unconditionally since it was
written, because nothing could produce a release. This is the other half: with a
writer, every refusal below becomes reachable, and the two that matter most are
the ones proving the axes COMPOSE.

## Two questions, two answers

"May this host be destroyed?" and "may a next lease take it as it stands?" are
different, and a host may legitimately answer yes to the first and no to the
second — `destroy_only` is exactly that. So reuse has its own gate, and it is
where `failed` and `outcome_unknown` cleanup refuse.
