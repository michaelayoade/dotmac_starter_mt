"""`ApplicationFoundationProfile.v1` — the contract refuses, the gate reports.

## The two halves, and the reader who will get this wrong

- **The type refuses.** A profile with a missing concern is unconstructable. No
  warning branch (ADR 0039 § 4).
- **The verification is report-only.** Nothing on the boot or deploy path is
  gated by profile completeness, because ADR 0039 stages the § 4 refusal per
  concern rather than switching it on for all thirteen at once. (A count of how
  many concerns the fleet can bind today used to stand here and was withdrawn on
  2026-09-04 — see `application_profile.py`'s docstring for why a facility must
  not hold a fleet-maturity fact it cannot check.)

Those are not in tension — they are the two halves the ADR's own staging
paragraph describes, and together they are exactly Michael's acceptance
condition: **a report-only implementation that can admit a real candidate and
reject planted defects.** The first half is what makes the planted defects
detectable at all.

`test_no_deployment_path_is_gated_by_profile_completeness` holds the second half
so that someone reading the first cannot quietly convert this into a live gate.
