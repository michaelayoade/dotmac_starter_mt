"""Recovery a product did not execute, bound so it cannot merely be claimed.

The frozen `0.3.0a2` wheel could not express any of this, and a read-only
measurement of that wheel is what these tests are written against:

* `BackupDataset.VERIFICATIONS` was byte-identical to the published 0.2 line, so
  a descriptor naming `roles`, `ownership`, `memberships` or
  `effective_privileges` was refused AT PARSE — while `recovery.py` had modelled
  every one of them since the bundle contract landed. The vocabulary existed and
  the descriptor could not reach it.
* `backup.assess()` computed the `restore_proof_max_age_days` window correctly
  and had **zero callers**, and `BackupRecord.restore_proved_at_epoch` was
  written by nothing in the package. The enforcement was inert because nothing
  supplied the records, not because the window was wrong.

So the tests below are organised by the seven properties rather than by module,
and each names the defect it repairs. The one to read first is
`test_the_restore_proof_window_now_refuses`: an enforcement nobody calls is the
exact failure being fixed, so a test that only checked `assess()`'s arithmetic
would have passed against the broken wheel too.
