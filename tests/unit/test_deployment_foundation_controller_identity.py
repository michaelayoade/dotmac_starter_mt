"""``ControllerSshFingerprintV1`` — the controller key, decoded rather than matched.

## The defect under test

Both planes of the lease contract carried the controller's SSH key fingerprint
as a bare string, and the release plane validated it against
``^sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}$``. That is the shape of a CONTENT DIGEST and not the
shape of an OpenSSH fingerprint: ``ssh-keygen -lf`` emits ``SHA256:`` followed by
43 characters of unpadded standard base64.

So the field named "the credential that mutated the host" would have refused
every real value and accepted a 64-hex string that is not a key fingerprint at
all. `test_the_old_hexadecimal_digest_shape_is_refused` and
`test_a_real_generated_key_is_accepted` are the two halves of that, and they must
BOTH hold: widening a regex would have satisfied only the second.

## Why decoding rather than a wider pattern

A wider regex accepts more strings. Establishing that a value IS a SHA-256
digest means decoding it and finding 32 bytes, and that is what this type does.
`test_a_wellformed_shape_that_is_not_32_bytes_is_refused` is the assertion a
shape-matching implementation cannot pass.

## Parsing proves shape; COMPARISON proves identity

The case that matters operationally is last:
`test_a_wellformed_fingerprint_of_the_WRONG_key_is_refused_where_compared`. A
substituted key whose fingerprint parses perfectly must be refused at the
destroy gate, because the gate's question is "is this a release for the key that
took the lease", not "is this a fingerprint".
