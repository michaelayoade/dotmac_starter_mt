"""``RecoveryExecutionPlanV1`` — a distinct document for a distinct act.

## What this file is really about

The plan type is the easy half. The half that earns the file is
**non-interchangeability**, and it is a live hazard rather than a theoretical
one, because `RecoveryExecutionPlanV1` deliberately carries no ``operation``
field.

On `FoundationExecutionPlanV1` that field does DOUBLE duty: it constrains the
vocabulary against `authorization.OPERATIONS`, and it makes the document
self-identifying. A recovery plan has no sibling to be told apart from, so the
field would carry no information — and a field carrying no information is one a
later author finds something to put in. Dropping it is right, and it leaves the
second job needing an owner. The owner is the SCHEMA, and an owner nobody drives
a swap through is a claim.

So every acceptance point below is exercised with a REAL document or object of
the wrong kind, in BOTH directions, and each must refuse with its OWN stable
code. A type annotation is not a check. `isinstance` in a docstring is not a
check. The swap is the check.

## Codes, not prose

This module has six refusals. Every assertion below reads `exc.value.code`
against a constant, because `match=` on a sentence makes the sentence the
contract — after which the message cannot be improved without breaking a test,
and a test that only ever saw one wording cannot tell two refusals apart. The
package made that argument for `discover_one` and `recovery_execution`; it holds
here for the same reason.

## Unreachable, and asserted so

Nothing constructs one of these on any path that touches a host. The last test
in this file derives that from the package source rather than stating it, so the
day someone wires it up they are told to come and read the staging argument
first.

#: Every module that canonicalizes a document with `json.dumps(sort_keys=...)`,
#: and how many times. FROZEN, ratcheted in BOTH directions.
#:
#: The first version of this test asserted that NO module outside the core did
#: this at all, and it was wrong in a way worth recording rather than quietly
#: fixing: it found sixteen sites and every one of them was correct. Canonical
#: JSON is not a plan concept. `evidence.py` canonicalizes a signed envelope,
#: `lease.py` a host lease, `recovery.py` a bundle manifest, `document.py` the
#: descriptor, `telemetry.py` resource attributes — none of them is a plan
#: document and none of them belongs behind `canonical_plan`. A detector whose
#: extent is "anything that looks like the thing I care about" reports every
#: neighbour, and the honest repair is to narrow the CLAIM rather than the scan.
#:
#: So this asserts what can actually be derived: the population of canonicalizing
#: modules is KNOWN and does not move silently. A new one fails here and gets a
#: reviewer, who decides the only question an AST cannot — is this a plan
#: document, and therefore `canonical_plan`'s, or is it its own kind? A removed
#: one fails too, because a debt list that can shrink silently stops describing
#: anything (ADR-0018).
#:
#: Keyed by MODULE and COUNT, never by line number: a line-keyed baseline fails
#: on every unrelated edit above it, and a baseline that cries wolf is one people

#: `scripts/` canonicalizes too, and until now nothing watched it. That blind
#: spot had a live instance: the Lane 3 runner and this package's `write_release`
#: were each about to ship their own writer for a `HostLeaseRelease.v1` into the
#: SAME store — two answers to one question, invisible to the population ratchet
#: above because its field of view stops at the package boundary.
#:
#: Neither lane was wrong; the seam was never named. That is exactly the kind of
#: duplication a reviewer cannot be expected to hold in their head across two
#: file sets, and exactly what a two-directional population baseline is for.
#:
#: Recorded per module, same as the package list, and it moves in BOTH
#: directions: `exposure_rehearsal_runner.py: 1` is the runner's own evidence
#: document. When it grew a second canonicalizer for the release record this
#: baseline is what said so, and when that second one is deleted in favour of
#: calling `lease.write_store_record_once`, the count returns here rather than
#: leaving a stale row nobody removes.
