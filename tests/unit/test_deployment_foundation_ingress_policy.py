"""`IngressPolicy.v1` — the typed exposure contract and its non-mutating projection.

Every refusal in this file was measured on the Dotmac fleet on 2026-08-29, and
each test names the measurement rather than the rule, because the rule without
the measurement is the version that gets relaxed in review.

## The four facts under test

1. **`ip6tables DOCKER-USER` is inert.** It is jumped only from `FORWARD`,
   while an IPv6 publish terminates on `INPUT` inside `docker-proxy`. Two
   production DROP rules were found written into it, both with zero packet
   counters, while the ports they named were open from the internet. The
   contract must refuse to emit there AND must still credit `ip6tables` with
   the containment it really has, in `INPUT`.
2. **A remapped publish needs `--ctorigdstport`.** In `DOCKER-USER` the packet
   is already DNATed, so its destination port is the CONTAINER port; a
   `--dport` rule written against the published port of a remapped publish
   matches nothing and reads, in a diff, exactly like a rule that works.
3. **An allowlist with no terminal DROP enforces nothing.** Everything the
   ACCEPTs miss falls through to the chain policy, which on a Docker host is
   ACCEPT. Check for the deny, not only the accepts.
4. **A short-form publish with no `host_ip` publishes on every family.** That
   is how two ports reached the public internet over IPv6 while their IPv4
   rules read as containment, and it is why long syntax is mandatory.

## Fixture shape

Descriptors are built from TOML through `ProductDeploymentSpec.loads` rather
than by constructing dataclasses, for the reason the compose tests give: a
hand-built dataclass skips every validation the parser applies, so a test
written that way proves the renderer works against objects no loader produces.

`_descriptor()` composes a MINIMAL valid descriptor and takes the publication
and ingress fragments as text, so a test that is about one refusal shows only
the lines that cause it.
