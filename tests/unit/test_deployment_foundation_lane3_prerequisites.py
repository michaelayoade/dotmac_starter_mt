"""The two prerequisites Lane 3 cannot start without: a lease, and a vantage.

Both encode a failure that actually happened on this fleet.

**The lease.** Measured on the rehearsal target 2026-08-30, `/var/lock` held
`lvm/` and `subsys/` and nothing else — there was no lease mechanism at all,
while eleven agents' worktrees shared the host. "Exclusive lease" was a sentence
in a plan, and a sentence is not a lock. The rule that shapes `lease.py` is that
a lease **cannot be self-granted**: it must reference the Platform CP
authorization run, because a holder who writes its own lease has proved only
that it can write a file.

**The vantage.** `94.72.99.155` was qualified as "outside every Dotmac
allowlist" on the strength of refusals, then found to hold a second NIC into a
private network. Re-measured 2026-08-30 that NIC is gone — which removed the
risk AND removed the discrimination control that depended on it. So
qualification is now a set of positive proofs, and the last one is measured from
the FAR END, because it is the only one a vantage cannot fake about itself.
