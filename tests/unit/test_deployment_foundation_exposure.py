"""Execution and proof for `IngressPolicy.v1`: apply it, then go and look.

Slice 1 proves the CONTRACT refuses the wrong descriptor. This file proves the
RUNTIME refuses the wrong host, which is a different question: a descriptor can
be perfect and the socket still wrong, and every way that happened on this
fleet has a case here.

## The mutation matrix

Each row is a real defect, planted into an otherwise-conforming observation, so
the verifier is shown to fail on it rather than merely to pass on a clean tree
(ADR-0018 — a checker over a conforming input passes for the wrong reason):

| planted | why the naive check misses it |
|---|---|
| a missing `host_ip` | short syntax publishes on every family; the file reads fine |
| a wildcard bind | the descriptor said loopback and the socket did not |
| the wrong address family | a v6 socket where only v4 was declared |
| an inert chain | v6 rules in `DOCKER-USER` count as rules and fire on nothing |
| an incomplete source set | ACCEPTs with no terminal DROP enforce nothing |
| `--dport` on a remapped publish | post-DNAT it matches the container port |
| a leftover `docker-proxy` | a socket no reviewed file describes |
| a private port bound to loopback | an outage that looks like a hardening |

## The privileged-vantage refusal

The workstation sits inside `160.119.124.0/22`, which several of this fleet's
allowlists explicitly ACCEPT. On 2026-08-29 two agents independently connected
to "public" ports from it and each escalated a P0 that did not exist. The
refusal is tested in both directions: a privileged vantage cannot conclude, and
an ESTABLISHED outside vantage can — a refusal that refused everything would
pass the first test and be useless.
