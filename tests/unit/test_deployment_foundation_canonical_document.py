"""`DeploymentDescriptorDocument.v1` — the value an authorization binds to.

`dotmac-deployment-control` owns authorization. It embeds a desired
specification in a frozen plan snapshot, hashes it, and requires an approver's
evidence to carry that exact digest. What was missing was one hop earlier: this
facility had no canonical document, only digests of rendered bytes, so no
descriptor fact was inside any plan digest at all.

Two properties carry this file.

**Completeness.** The descriptor half is derived by walking
`dataclasses.fields`, never by a hand-written serializer, because a
hand-written one is a field allow-list wearing a different hat — the next field
somebody adds stays out of the digest, silently, and nobody finds out until an
unapproved change ships under an approved digest. `test_a_new_descriptor_field_
is_covered_without_touching_this_module` plants a field and proves it.

**Exclusion.** Resolved endpoints, IP addresses, credential bindings and secret
values must not reach the document. That is not tidiness: Control binds this
digest into an independently signed authorization and resolves the private
material separately, so the moment a resolved address can reach the digest, the
two owners have collapsed into one. The guard runs over the FINISHED document
rather than inside each builder, because the risk is a field nobody thought
about — and it has a planted-defect proof, because a scanner over a clean tree
passes for the wrong reason (ADR-0018).
