"""SPI 1.1 — the frozen contract, and the proof that each refusal bites.

`ConnectorMode` shipped in SPI 1.0 with three members and nothing consulting
them. The consequences ran from "cannot work" to "works wrongly":

* `INGRESS` had no executable protocol at all, so a webhook connector could be
  declared and never run;
* `POLL` likewise — a label with no machinery behind it;
* `DELIVERY` was invoked WITHOUT checking the declaration, so a binding pointed
  at an ingress-only connector reached `handler_for` and failed with an
  `AttributeError` from inside a lookup, which reads as a broken plugin rather
  than as a misconfigured binding.

SPI 1.1 answers all three: a base protocol carrying identity and metadata, one
executable protocol per mode, an implication checked in BOTH directions at
discovery, and the SHAPE of what a factory returns checked rather than merely
its presence.

Every guard below is paired with a case that makes it FIRE. A test that only
shows a guard accepting a good connector proves nothing about what it refuses,
and the empty-set trap is real here: three of these checks would pass vacuously
against a plugin that declares no modes.
