"""``HostLeaseRelease.v1`` — the other end of the lease contract.

`load_lease` refuses to BEGIN without a lease record. Nothing recorded the END,
so the only evidence a shared host was finished with was the absence of a running
process and a timestamp going by. Both are inferences.

## The design under test: EXPIRY IS NOT RELEASE

Three standings, not a boolean. A boolean "is the lease live?" has two values for
three cases, so one case borrows another's answer — and the borrowed one is
always the crash, because a crashed run and a finished one both stop being live.

`EXPIRED_HELD` is that third case, and
`test_an_expired_lease_does_NOT_authorize_destruction` is the assertion the whole
module exists for.

## A refused run is terminal

A schema accepting only receipts would hold a host forever after any legitimate
refusal, and somebody would release it by hand — the mechanism this record exists
to remove. So a refusal releases, and the refusal vocabulary is closed and owned
here: a schema validating against a set the writer invents is not a validation.
