"""DotMac Template Studio — tenant-authored NOTIFICATION templates.

The FIRST stateful module (ADR-0006: "dotmac-template-studio a MODULE — the first
stateful one, not a kernel facility"). It owns the `mod_tstudio` schema and its
own `ts` migration lineage, and it is installed by an assembly rather than
imported by the kernel.

## Its one decision: what the message SAYS

ADR-0006 § 5b narrowed this module to a single owned decision. It renders and
returns `(subject, body)`. It does **not** decide whether a message may be sent
(consent), over what (channel policy), how it is actually sent (delivery), or
produce documents — those are four separate foundation owners. A module that
absorbed them would be the merge the 2026-08-10 source audit disqualified.

Documents in particular are NOT served here: ERP's document templates need Jinja
control flow, filters and page geometry, and this module substitutes rather than
evaluates, on purpose.

## The public surface

Everything below is what a consuming assembly may use. Anything else is internal
and may change without a contract bump.

- `module` — the `ModuleManifest` an assembly puts in `ProductAssemblySpec.modules`.
- `RenderContext` / `register_contexts()` — the product declares which send paths
  exist and exactly which variables each can supply. Template Studio owns the
  CHECKING; the product owns the VOCABULARY (ADR-0008). A deployment that
  registers no context can create no template.
- `template_dir()` — the packaged Jinja directory declared by the module's
  namespaced `WebSurfaceContribution` (also public for packaging inspection).
- `migrations_dir()` — the packaged Alembic version location for the assembly's
  `version_locations`.
- `service` — the module's own logic, for a product that wants to render a
  template from its own code rather than over HTTP. This is the SUPPORTED way to
  reach Template Studio in-process; the models are not.
- `rendering.render` — single-brace substitution without loading the module's
  web surface or persistence service.

## What a consumer must NOT do

Import `dotmac_template_studio.models` and query it directly. The tables are an
implementation detail behind `service`, and reaching past it re-creates the
parallel-writer problem the source-of-truth standard exists to prevent.
