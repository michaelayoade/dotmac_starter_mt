"""Render a deterministic docker-compose document from a deployment spec.

`ProductDeploymentSpec` is the one thing a product declares (see `spec.py`);
this module is one of the several pure renderers that turn it into an actual
deployment artifact — in this case the docker-compose file a host runs. It
never asks a question the descriptor did not already answer: image, ports,
resource limits, security posture, and dependency order are all DERIVED, so
two products built from the same descriptor cannot disagree about the
resulting compose file, and a descriptor left unchanged renders byte-identical
output no matter when or how many times it is rendered.

## Why hand-rolled YAML

`dotmac-deployment-foundation` ships with ZERO runtime dependencies — that is
what lets a build runner adopt it without adopting a templating engine, a YAML
library, or anything else that could itself drift between renders. A
hand-written emitter is also what makes a future `dotmac-deploy render
--check` meaningful: the committed compose file and a fresh render are
compared BYTE FOR BYTE, and a reviewer reads any difference as an ordinary
text diff rather than as two YAML documents that merely happen to describe the
same thing.

## What is derived, and from where

- The one-shot `migrate` service exists because migration is not a role a
  product declares (`ProductDeploymentSpec.migration`, not
  `ProductDeploymentSpec.roles`) — it is a property of the WHOLE deployment,
  and giving it a dedicated, minimal service is what keeps the owner
  credential (`migration.owner_material`) out of every runtime container.
  `spec.py`'s `_validate_cross_field` already refuses a role that names the
  owner material; this module is the second, independent line of defence
  that docstring promises — nothing here ever reads `owner_material` while
  building a runtime role's environment.
- A role's readiness probe becomes the compose `healthcheck` — the gate
  `depends_on: service_healthy` actually consumes — while its liveness probe
  becomes a label (`io.dotmac.health.live.path`) for a collector to find,
  never the healthcheck itself. Wiring a liveness probe (which by contract
  never touches a dependency — see `spec.py`'s `HealthCheck` docstring) into
  `service_healthy` would make that condition trivially true and defeat the
  whole point of a readiness gate.
- Published ports come from two places and are emitted in ONE syntax. An
  ingress route derives a loopback publication of its upstream, because a
  role behind an edge is reached through that edge on the host and not from
  outside it. Everything else is a `[[roles.ports]]` or
  `[[external_dependencies.ports]]` publication whose `exposure` and
  `address_family` are DECLARED (`IngressPolicy.v1`), and whose bind address
  is derived from them. Both render as Compose LONG SYNTAX, one entry per
  declared family, so `host_ip` is a field that cannot be omitted rather
  than a string position that can — see `_published_port_lines` for the
  IPv6 `docker-proxy` failure that forced it.

## Deployment identity, stamped on every service

Every service carries `io.dotmac.deployment.*` labels naming the product, the
environment, the compose service and what KIND of thing it is; the services
that run the product's own image carry the manifest digest, the configuration
digest and the source revision as well.

The labels exist because a controller that cannot read a release's identity
off the running object has to infer it, and the two things available to infer
from are both wrong. An image TAG is mutable — the same tag names different
bytes on different days, which is exactly why this facility pins a digest
everywhere else. A compose PROJECT name is an operator's `-p` flag or the
directory the file happens to sit in; it is renamed by moving a checkout.
Neither is an authorized identity, and a controller that reconciles against an
inferred one reconciles the wrong release confidently.

The labels are also written by the RENDERER rather than by whatever performed
the deployment, so the identity travels with the file. A rendered compose file
copied to a host and started by hand carries the same identity as one the
engine deployed — and `render --check` proves the labels on a host match the
descriptor, which it could not do for a value the deploy step injected.

## Assumptions this renderer makes beyond the descriptor

`ProductDeploymentSpec` deliberately leaves some things to the renderer (see
its docstring, "what this type deliberately does NOT hold"); the choices
below are THIS MODULE's, not the descriptor's, and are named here so a
reviewer can tell a genuine descriptor gap from a rendering decision:

- **Host port == container port, for an INGRESS-DERIVED publication only.**
  An ingress route names one port, so it is reused for both sides of the
  loopback binding. A declared publication carries `host` and `container`
  separately and is remapped whenever they differ — which is also why a
  derived firewall rule matches `--ctorigdstport` rather than `--dport`.
- **Uploads mount path.** `StaticStrategy` names a volume but not a mount
  point; this renderer mounts it at `/srv/uploads` in every role an ingress
  route targets.
- **Log rotation budget.** Neither `Resources` nor `Role` carries a
  log-rotation policy, so every service gets the same fixed `json-file`
  budget (`_LOG_MAX_SIZE`/`_LOG_MAX_FILE` below) rather than an unbounded
  default.
- **The `migrate` service's own resource/security envelope.** `Migration`
  has no `resources`/`security` table of its own — DDL is a deployment
  property, not a role — so this renderer gives it a fixed, hardened
  envelope (`_MIGRATE_RESOURCES`/`_MIGRATE_SECURITY` below) rather than
  leaving the one process with the widest database grant unbounded.
- **`migrate`'s `stop_grace_period`.** Derived from
  `migration.lock_timeout_seconds` — the same budget the migration itself is
  already bounded by — rather than inventing an unrelated constant.

    binds an approval to, so the value stamped on a container is the same value
    an approval names and the comparison is an `==` rather than a translation.
    A second, renderer-private digest of "roughly the same thing" would be the
    two-spellings-of-one-value failure `digest.py` exists to prevent.

    It cannot be a digest of the rendered compose file, which is the shape a
    reader expects and the one thing that cannot work: the label lives inside
    the file it would be describing, so the value would have to contain its own
    hash. `render --check` already digests the rendered bytes; this answers the
    different question of what the bytes were rendered FROM.

    The digest is taken over the descriptor as ACTUALLY RENDERED, image
    override included. During a rollback the file runs an image the descriptor
    does not name, and a label reporting the descriptor's own digest would
    claim a configuration whose image field disagrees with the container next
    to it. Substituting the effective image means a rollback to a previously
    approved image reproduces that image's approved digest exactly, and a
    rollback to anything else is visibly not an approved configuration — both
    of which are true statements, which the unsubstituted version is not.

    Consequence worth knowing before it surprises somebody: the canonical
    document carries the exact facility version (`document.py` rule 5), so
    upgrading `dotmac-deployment-foundation` changes this value and therefore
    the rendered bytes. `render --check` fails until the assets are
    re-rendered. That is the intended behaviour rather than a cost of it — the
    version is in the digest precisely because a renderer upgrade can change

    setting, and Compose refuses a project where they disagree:

        services.app: can't set distinct values on 'pids_limit' and
        'deploy.resources.limits.pids': invalid compose project

    An ABSENT `pids` under `limits` counts as disagreeing, so emitting
    `pids_limit` beside a `limits` block that lists only cpus and memory —
    which is what this function used to do — produced a file the engine
    refused to load.

    SCOPE OF THAT CLAIM. Observed on **Docker 28.0.4 / Compose 2.38.2** (the
    GitHub runner, where the rehearsal hit it) and independently reproduced on
    **Docker 29.4.3 / Compose v5.1.3**; the repair is accepted by both. It also
    follows from the Compose specification treating the two keys as aliases.
    That is two versions agreeing, roughly a major apart — not a matrix, and
    not a statement about engines nobody has run. Before any product cutover,
    census the adopter hosts' engine versions and record them
    (`docs/inventories/deployment-foundation-rehearsal.md`, "Engine
    evidence").

    Nothing in this repository could have caught it: the renderer emits text,
    and only an engine knows which text it accepts. The disposable-host
    rehearsal did, on its first run (same document, Lane 2).

    Both keys are written rather than just the nested one, so an engine that
    reads only the legacy key still gets the limit. Writing both is safe
    EXACTLY as long as the values are identical, which
    `test_the_two_pids_keys_never_disagree` holds.
