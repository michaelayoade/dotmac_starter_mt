"""Recovery a product did not execute, bound so it cannot be claimed.

The frozen `0.3.0a2` wheel could not express this at all, and the measurement
that found it is the reason this module exists. `BackupDataset.VERIFICATIONS`
carried three words — `schema`, `row_counts`, `migration_heads` — so a descriptor
declaring `effective_privileges` was refused at parse even though `recovery.py`
already modelled `MEMBERSHIPS`, `OBJECT_OWNERSHIP` and
`CatalogEvidence.effective_privileges`. The vocabulary existed and the
descriptor could not reach it. And `backup.assess()`, which computes whether the
last proved restore is older than `restore_proof_max_age_days`, had **zero
callers**: the window was correct, and nothing consulted it, because nothing
supplied the records it reads.

Both halves matter and neither fixes the other. Widening the vocabulary without
a caller for `assess()` gives a richer declaration nobody checks; calling
`assess()` without records gives an enforcement with nothing to enforce over.

## The shape: a receipt, not a claim

When the party that executes recovery is not the deploying product — a managed
database service, a backup platform, an operator team, a sibling product — the
deployment cannot observe the restore. It can only be TOLD about it, and the
entire question is what makes being told different from assuming.

* **The executor is typed** (:class:`ExternalExecutorV1`). Never a free-text
  owner: `owner = "the DBA team"` cannot be compared with anything, so a receipt
  from a different party reads identically to the right one. Kind is a closed
  set, identifier is machine-shaped, and the executor's own VERSION is part of
  its identity — a receipt from v1 and one from v2 of the same platform are
  different facts about different procedures.

* **The dataset identity is independent of host and executor**
  (:class:`DatasetIdentityV1`). If identity were the host, moving the database
  would silently orphan every proof; if it were the executor, changing supplier
  would. Both are exactly when you most need the old proofs to still be about
  the same data, so the lineage is a declared opaque token and this module
  refuses one that is host-shaped or that repeats the executor's identifier.

* **The receipt is SIGNED and bound** (:class:`ExternalRecoveryReceiptV1`) to
  the dataset identity, the descriptor digest, the snapshot checksum, the
  executor identity AND version, and the exact verification set that ran. Drop
  any one and the receipt is reusable somewhere it was never meant to apply —
  the same enumeration `authorization.ExecutionGrant` makes for a deploy
  approval.

* **No verifier means refuse.** Not "skip signature checking". Same rule, same
  reason, as `evidence.accept_release_evidence`: a facility that degrades to
  trusting unsigned input when its verifier is missing has a bypass anybody can
  trigger by deleting configuration.

* **The receipt is passed in, never discovered.** There is no directory scan and
  no `Effects.find_receipt()` — a caller hands over the exact envelope, exactly
  as `--authorization` hands over an `AuthorizationReceipt`. Ambient discovery
  is how a stale receipt from a previous quarter satisfies today's gate.

## And the record it produces

`assess()` reads `BackupRecord`s. Nothing wrote one at
:attr:`~.backup.Assurance.PROVED` with a `restore_proved_at_epoch`, which is why
the window was inert. :func:`backup_record_from_receipt` is that writer, and
:func:`require_restore_proof` is the caller: together they close
receipt → record → assessment → refusal.

## Cadence and proof age are TWO controls

`expected_backup_interval_seconds` is how often a backup is expected. It decides
STALENESS. `restore_proof_max_age_days` is how old the newest proved restore may
be. It decides whether recovery has been demonstrated at all.

They are not two names for one number and must not be merged. A product taking
hourly backups nobody has ever restored is failing the second while passing the
first, and that is the exact state the fleet was in.
