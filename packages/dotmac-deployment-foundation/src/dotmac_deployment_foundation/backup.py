"""Backup, restore rehearsal, and the difference between them.

Every product in the fleet backs up. No product in the fleet has ever proved a
restore. That asymmetry is the whole content of this module, and it is not a
detail: an untested backup is a belief, and the moment its truth is established
is always the worst possible one.

## What the sources actually verify — and a correction

An earlier version of this docstring said `pg_dump | gzip` reports gzip's exit
status, so a half-written dump passes. **That is wrong, and the correction is
worth keeping rather than quietly deleting.** All three scripts set `set -euo
pipefail`, and `pipefail` makes a pipeline return the rightmost non-zero status —
so a `pg_dump` that exits non-zero DOES fail the backup in every one of them.

| Product | What it establishes | What it does not |
|---|---|---|
| `dotmac_sub` | `pipefail`, non-empty check | integrity, restorability |
| `dotmac_erp` | `pipefail` + the `rclone` exit code | integrity, restorability |
| `dotmac_starter_mt` | `pipefail` + a non-empty check | integrity, restorability |
| `dotmac_integrator` | nothing — no backup exists | everything |

So the real gap is narrower than the retracted claim and still serious. What is
verified is **completion**: the command ran and exited zero. What is not
verified is anything after that — no checksum is recorded at write time, so
corruption during the write, the `rclone` transfer or a year on disk is
invisible; nothing decompresses the archive to prove it is readable end to end;
and **no product has ever restored one**. `dotmac_erp:scripts/restore_from_backup.py`
can restore; nothing runs it on a schedule and nothing records when a restore
last succeeded.

That is why the levels below start at COMPLETED rather than at "it ran": the
sources establish exactly the first level, and every claim a recovery plan
actually depends on lives above it.

## The four levels, deliberately named apart

1. **Completed** — the command exited zero. Says nothing about content.
2. **Verified** — the artefact is intact: expected magic bytes, a full
   decompression, and a checksum recorded at write time that still matches.
3. **Restorable** — it was actually restored into a disposable database.
4. **Proved** — the restored database was inspected: the expected schema is
   present, row counts are within tolerance, and the migration heads match.

Only (4) supports a recovery-point/recovery-time claim. `BackupRecord` keeps
the four apart so that a dashboard cannot report (1) as though it were (4),
which is exactly what "last backup: 2 hours ago" means today.

## What this module does NOT do

It runs no `pg_dump`, opens no socket and reads no credential. It computes the
POLICY — what to back up, how to verify it, whether the last proof is too old —
and the deployment host's `Effects` implementation performs it. That is what
lets the policy be exercised by tests, and a backup policy nobody exercises is
the same shape of problem as a backup nobody restores.
