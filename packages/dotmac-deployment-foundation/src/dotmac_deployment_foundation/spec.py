"""Strict ``ProductDeploymentSpec.v1`` and ``.v2`` readers.

A product assembly owns exactly one deployment artifact: `deploy/product.toml`.
Everything else a deployment needs — the Compose file, the Nginx site, the
collector configuration, the alert rules, the ordered deployment plan — is
RENDERED from it by this package. That is the whole build-once claim: the
variation lives in a typed value, never in a copied template and never in a
branch inside shared code.

## Reading rules that are load-bearing

**Unknown keys are refused, not ignored.** A typo in ``read_only`` that
silently disables a read-only filesystem is the exact class of defect this
facility exists to remove, and a permissive parser converts it from a CI
failure into a production one.

**The schema string is checked first and fails closed.** A descriptor written
against a future schema may declare fields whose ABSENCE changes behaviour
rather than merely losing detail — a security exception, say — so an older
renderer refuses rather than rendering a subset it believes is complete.

**Secrets are refused before any field is interpreted** (`secrets_guard`), so a
value pasted into a field the schema does not define is still caught.

**Every duration is seconds and every duration field says so in its name.** A
descriptor that mixes ``timeout = 30`` and ``timeout = "30s"`` across products
is a units bug waiting for the one host where it matters.

## What this type deliberately does NOT hold

- Secret values. Material NAMES and approved pointers only (ADR-0009).
- Environment-specific addresses. A host name is ingress identity; a database
  address is a material the deployment host resolves.
- Anything the facility can derive. Resource attributes, container names and
  the plan's step order are DERIVED, so two products cannot disagree about
  them.

V1 is immutable. V2 adds only typed database-catalogue coordinates: a v1
document carrying that key is refused, while v1 canonical bytes omit the
version-gated dataclass field entirely.

    """A port this role publishes, beyond whatever ingress routes to it.

    Ingress-routed ports are DERIVED from `[[ingress.routes]]` and must not be
    declared here — two sources for one port is how they drift. This section is
    for the ports ingress cannot describe, and the case that forced it is
    `dotmac_sub`'s syslog listener: **UDP 514**. An HTTP reverse proxy has no
    way to express a UDP listener, so a descriptor with no port section drops it
    silently and the rendered file is missing the one thing that service is for.

    ## Why `bind` was replaced (0.3.0a1)

    `bind` was a free-form string defaulting to loopback, and its docstring
    asked that widening it "be visible in a diff". That is review discipline,
    not a refusal, and it could not express the question that actually matters:
    WHICH ADDRESS FAMILIES. A short-form publish spawns one `docker-proxy` per
    family, so a descriptor that says nothing about IPv6 gets IPv6 anyway — and
    the `ip6tables DOCKER-USER` rules written to cover it cannot fire, because
    that chain is reachable only from FORWARD while `docker-proxy` terminates an
    IPv6 connection locally on INPUT. Every such rule measured on this fleet
    showed a zero packet counter while the port it named was open.

    So `exposure` and `address_family` are DECLARED, both mandatory, and the
    bind address is DERIVED from them. A derived address cannot be misleading;
    a declared one repeatedly was.

    ## What is declared, and what is resolved elsewhere

    Everything here is a NAME or a posture. `source_set` names a set;
    `dotmac-deployment-control` resolves it to addresses at authorization and
    freezes the result into the plan digest. `approval_ref` names a policy;
    `dotmac-approvals` decides. This facility can refuse a shape and can never
    grant one, which is exactly the amount of authority a renderer should have.

    """One thing that is backed up, and the proof it can come back.

    ``restore_proof_max_age_days`` is the field that separates a backup from a
    belief. An untested backup has never been shown to restore, and the moment
    at which that is discovered is always the worst possible one.

    ``expected_backup_interval_seconds`` is a SEPARATE control and must stay
    one. It is how often a backup is expected, and it decides staleness; the
    field above is how old the newest PROVED restore may be, and it decides
    whether recovery has ever been demonstrated. A product taking hourly backups
    nobody has ever restored passes the first and fails the second, which is
    precisely the state the fleet was in — so merging them would delete the only
    control that was reporting the real problem.

    ``lineage`` names the DATA, independently of the host it currently lives on
    and the party that holds it (`recovery_identity.DatasetIdentityV1`). Those
    are the two things that change while the data does not, and a proof keyed to
    either is orphaned at the exact moment it matters. Optional, because a
    dataset the product restores itself needs no cross-party identity — but
    REQUIRED the moment an external executor is declared.

    ``external_executor`` is what turns a `backup` step into a
    `verify_external_recovery_receipt` step: when another party executes
    recovery, this deployment cannot observe the restore and must not emit a
    plan step claiming it performed one.
