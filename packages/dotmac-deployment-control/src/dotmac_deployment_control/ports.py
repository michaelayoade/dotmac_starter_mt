"""The module's inbound contract: intent in, provider-neutral observations back.

This module sits between two things it must not become. On one side is the
Integrator, which moves bytes and speaks to providers. On the other is
`dotmac-licensing`, which decides what a deployment is authorised to run. This
module decides only what SHOULD be deployed, whether it HAS been, and what to do
about the difference.

## Two source modes, and the boundary between them is recorded

ADR-0033 § 3 splits this module's provenance, and `EXTRACTION.toml` records it as
`historical-mixed` rather than claiming one mode it cannot support:

- **The receipt half is a tested reference.** Vendor's V6 slices
  (`admission.py`, `admission_models.py`, `credentials.py`,
  `credential_models.py`) are ported with their design, including the two
  decisions below that are easy to get wrong and expensive to get wrong twice.
  Those branches were never merged and never deployed, and their migration slots
  were later reused by different work on Vendor `main` — so they are a *tested
  reference*, not a production-used implementation.
- **The plan/rollout half is greenfield**, with the absence of any source
  evidenced across every branch, stash, dangling object and reflog of the Vendor
  repository plus seven other repositories.

## Two decisions ported from the reference, because both are counter-intuitive

**1. A claim is not a proof, and they get separate columns.**

An inbound report names a deployment. That name is EVIDENCE and never authority.
The authoritative identity is the one resolved from the *signed* `key_id` by
`dotmac_kernel.licensing.verify_applied_state` (ADR-0007 § 4). Storing both in
one column would make "did we actually verify this?" unanswerable after the
fact — and would make deployment binding decorative, since anyone reaching the
endpoint could activate any target's deployment by naming it.

**2. Attempts and reports are two tables, not one.**

A single append-only table keyed uniquely on `(identity, report_id)` cannot work:
the SECOND arrival under a key is exactly the row worth keeping — the replay, or
the conflicting bytes — and the unique constraint forbids inserting it. Updating
the first row instead breaks append-only semantics AND discards the conflicting
bytes, destroying the evidence the table exists to preserve. It also leaves
nowhere to record an arrival that never resolved to an identity at all: an
unknown key, a malformed envelope, a bad signature. Those are the tripwires, and
a fail-closed system that discards them silently is the worst of both.

So: an append-only log of ATTEMPTS, and one canonical REPORT per idempotency key.

## What this module refuses to hold

- **Provider credentials.** `TargetCredential` holds a deployment's own PUBLIC
  verification key — the target's identity, not a way to reach a provider. There
  is no private material and no provider secret anywhere in this package.
- **A provider client.** No SSH, Kubernetes, cloud or panel client; no webhook
  verification; no connector retry or checkpoint state. All of it is the
  Integrator's (ADR-0024, hard rule 28).
- **A release catalogue, a licence, or a brand definition.** `release_ref`,
  `licence_ref` and `brand_profile_ref` are opaque strings with no foreign key.
