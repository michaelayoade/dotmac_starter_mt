"""The deployment-control tables, bound to `mod_deploy` (ADR-0006 D1).

Platform catalog tables: no `tenant_id`, no RLS, `app_user` REVOKEd. Deciding
what a fleet of deployments should run is a control-plane act; the deployments
themselves are separate applications that learn what to do through the
Integrator, never by reading this schema (ADR-0024).

## Seven tables, and the two pairings that matter

Most of these are the obvious decomposition — target, credential, plan, rollout,
attempt. Two are not:

**`observation_attempts` and `observation_receipts` are a pair, not a
duplication.** A single append-only table keyed uniquely on
`(identity, report_id)` cannot work: the SECOND arrival under a key is exactly
the row worth keeping — the replay, or the conflicting bytes — and the unique
constraint forbids inserting it. Updating the first row instead breaks
append-only semantics AND discards the conflicting bytes, destroying the evidence
the table exists to preserve. It also leaves nowhere to record an arrival that
never resolved to an identity: an unknown key, a malformed envelope, a bad
signature. Those are the tripwires.

So: an append-only log of ATTEMPTS (every arrival, whatever happens to it) and
one canonical RECEIPT per idempotency key.

**`rollouts` and `rollout_attempts` are a pair for the same reason in a
different domain.** A rollout is the DECISION to converge a target on a plan; an
attempt is one execution of it. Retrying does not change the decision, and
collapsing them would make "how many times did we try?" and "what did we decide?"
one column that answers neither.

## A claim and a proof never share a column

`observation_attempts.authenticated_target_ref` is the identity resolved from the
SIGNED key (ADR-0007 § 4). `claimed_target_ref` is what the report said about
itself. Two columns, with a CHECK making it structural: a row may carry an
authenticated ref only when something actually authenticated it.

One column holding both would make deployment binding decorative — anyone
reaching the endpoint could activate any target's deployment by naming it — and
would make "did we actually verify this?" unanswerable after the fact.

## There is no private key and no provider credential anywhere

`TargetCredential` holds a deployment's own PUBLIC verification key: the target's
identity, not a way to reach a provider. Provider credentials, endpoints,
transports and connector state are the Integrator's (ADR-0024, hard rule 28), and
the absence here is structural rather than conventional.

## No foreign key leaves this schema

`release_ref`, `licence_ref` and `brand_profile_ref` are bare strings. A
deployment record must outlive a superseded release and a replaced licence, and
ADR-0006 D1 forbids the cross-lineage foreign key that would splice four module
lineages into one release unit.

## Status is text with no CHECK

ADR-0008's reason: adding a lifecycle member should cost a module release, not an
`ALTER TYPE` on every deployment. The CHECKs that ARE here constrain things true
independent of any vocabulary — versions and attempt numbers start at 1, and a
claim/proof pairing cannot contradict itself.
