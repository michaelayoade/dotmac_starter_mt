"""The versioned facts this module publishes, and the views it returns.

An adopting assembly reads these off the platform outbox and reacts: the
Integrator picks up a `deployment.intent.dispatched.v1` and delivers, an operator
console surfaces `deployment.drift.detected.v1`, a support queue picks up
`deployment.rollout.manual_repair.v1`. **This module calls none of them**
(ADR-0024): it records a decision and emits the fact; the assembly routes it.

## The version is in the event type

`deployment.rollout.succeeded.v1`, not `deployment.rollout.succeeded`. A consumer
pins a shape; when it changes incompatibly, `v2` is emitted alongside `v1` for a
migration window. An unversioned type makes that impossible to do safely.

## Drift is a FACT, not a status column

There is no `is_drifted` boolean anywhere in this module. Drift is the computed
difference between what a plan rolled out and what the target last reported, and
computing it on demand means it cannot go stale. A cached flag would have to be
invalidated by every desired-state edit, every observation and every rollout —
three writers for one derived value, which is the shape ADR-0010 exists to
prevent.

`DriftReport` is what that computation returns, and `deployment.drift.detected.v1`
is emitted when an observation makes it non-empty.
