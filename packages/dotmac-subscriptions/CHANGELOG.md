# Changelog

## 0.1.0a1

- Extract Sub's cadence, contract-version, proration, rating-provenance, and
  recurring-occurrence behavior behind product-neutral typed contracts.
- Add structurally immutable offer/price publication with exact money.
- Add selectable tenant and platform persistence planes with one lifecycle.
- Correct clamped month-end rate-unit counting so 31 January to 28 February
  rates as one calendar month, with an explicit product-source regression test.
- Publish `RatedObligationOutputV1` and
  `CommercialEntitlementProjectionV1` without importing their consumers.
- Require `dotmac-kernel>=0.1.0a94`, the first released kernel contract carrying
  the manifest-owned `charge_models` and `obligation_sources` declarations
  consumed by the write-path vocabulary guard.
