"""Who OWNS a capability contract — and the three ways a declaration is wrong.

`provider-capability-sources.md` § 7.2 records the gap this module closes:

    There is no capability-id *registry* anywhere in the fleet. The id is an
    open string checked by a regex, with no declaration, no owner and no
    collision check across distributions.

ADR-0008's answer to an open vocabulary is a declaration registry, and its
governing rule is the one that shapes every line below: **the layer that HOSTS a
vocabulary never enumerates its members.** `dotmac-integration` hosts capability
ids. It therefore contains no capability-id literal of its own — proven, not
promised, by `tests/architecture/test_capability_ownership.py`.

## Three parties, three verbs

=========================== ================================================
party                       verb
=========================== ================================================
the **business domain owner** DECLARES the capability. `messaging.receive.v1`
                            is Sub's communications contract; Sub says what an
                            inbound message means, and nobody else can.
**`dotmac-integration`**    VALIDATES and BINDS the declaration. It refuses a
                            duplicate, an unknown and an orphan. It never mints
                            one.
the **connector plugin**    IMPLEMENTS a declared capability at an accepted
                            version. A manifest is a claim to implement, never
                            a claim to define.
=========================== ================================================

That split is ADR-0030 § 8.2's, restated as executable refusals.

## The declaration cannot be an import

ADR-0024 makes applications independent: the Integrator does not import Sub, and
could not — they are separate deployments with separate databases. So a
declaration travels as DATA, supplied by the composing assembly at startup, in
exactly the shape `dotmac_kernel.secret_sources.install_secret_source` already
established for material the module cannot fetch for itself:

* installed ONCE, by :func:`install_capability_registry`;
* read afterwards as a plain lookup, never a fetch;
* **fail closed** — :func:`capability_registry` raises when nothing was
  installed, because an empty registry and an uninstalled one are different
  facts and treating them alike would let a misconfigured assembly accept every
  binding by declaring nothing.

## Three failures, three exceptions, three messages

A single "invalid capability" error would tell an operator that something is
wrong and not what to do about it. Each of these has a different fix, so each
has its own type and its own sentence:

:class:`DuplicateCapabilityDeclaration`
    Two owners claim one id, or one owner declared it twice. Fixed by the
    domain owners, agreeing which of them owns the contract.

:class:`UnknownCapabilityError`
    A binding — or a connector manifest — names an id nobody declared. Fixed by
    the operator, binding a declared capability instead.

:class:`OrphanCapabilityError`
    A declaration no installed connector implements. Fixed by the deployment,
    installing a connector that implements it or retiring the declaration.

The orphan check is the one that looks optional and is not. A declared
capability with no implementation reads, on an operations screen, exactly like a
working integration: the contract is published, the vocabulary resolves, and
nothing will ever arrive. That is ADR-0008's "dead vocabulary that reads as a
working gate", in the one registry where the silence is indistinguishable from
an idle channel.

## The SCHEMA is here too, for exactly the same reason as the id

ADR-0024 § 10 (2026-08-24). A capability id was already one contract with one
owner; its PAYLOAD was not. `CapabilityDeclaration` carried a config schema and
`DispatchRequest.payload` was an unvalidated `dict[str, object]`, so
configuration had a declared contract and commands did not — which is how one id
grew two disjoint command vocabularies without any gate noticing.

The obvious repair — let each connector publish a command schema — is the wrong
one, and § 10.1 says why: two connectors serving one id would then publish two
individually valid schemas, and the engine would have no ground to prefer
either. Machine-readable disagreement is still disagreement. So the schema lives
where the MEANING already lives, on the contract the owning application
publishes, of which this registry already permits exactly one per id:

* :attr:`CapabilityContract.command_schema` — what a product may SEND;
* :attr:`CapabilityContract.result_schema` — what a connector may RETURN;
* :attr:`CapabilityContract.observation_schema` — what an inbound fact IS;
* :attr:`CapabilityContract.contract_digest` — those three, canonicalized, so
  agreement is a comparison and never a re-derivation;
* :class:`ContractDeprecation` — which id replaces this one, and by when.

A connector may only CLAIM that digest
(:attr:`~dotmac_integration.spi.CapabilityDeclaration.claims_contract_digest`).
A claim is not a definition.

## What a contract with no schema is allowed to be

Fail-closed on SILENCE, not on absence. Every capability in the fleet predates
this rule, so a contract may still be ungated — but only by SAYING SO, with a
:class:`SchemaGrace` carrying a reason and a `retire_after` date. A contract that
declares neither a schema nor a grace is refused at construction.

That distinction is the whole adoption argument. A permanently optional
`command_schema` is how this defect returns: every future contract would be free
to publish nothing, and the register of what is ungated would be
indistinguishable from the register of what nobody has looked at. A declared,
dated grace makes the ungated set enumerable (:func:`schema_grace_register`),
attributable to an owner, and finite — the window closes, and closing it is a
reviewable diff rather than a decision nobody ever makes.

## A published version is SUCCEEDED, never redefined

ADR-0024 § 11. Three refusals carry it, none of which needs a durable row:

* a schema change changes the digest, so every connector claiming the old one is
  refused at composition AND at binding;
* :func:`install_capability_registry` refuses a reload that gives an already
  published id a DIFFERENT digest — replacement stays allowed, redefinition does
  not;
* a contract that declares itself deprecated must name a successor that is
  declared in the same registry, so a retirement cannot point at nothing.

    `command_schema`, `result_schema` and `observation_schema` are the payload

    legitimate for a capability that genuinely has all three; declaring NONE is
    refused unless a :class:`SchemaGrace` says so explicitly.

    not "schemas are optional for now". Optional-for-now has no end and no

    """Adapter for an owner publishing its declaration as SPI-shaped data.

    Exists so an owning application can hand over the same
    :class:`~dotmac_integration.spi.CapabilityDeclaration` value its connector
    authors read, rather than restating the id in a second shape where the two
    can drift.

    The schemas are taken as arguments and NOT read off the declaration, because
    the declaration has nowhere to hold them and must not grow one: a
    `CapabilityDeclaration` is a claim to implement (ADR-0024 § 10.3). What this
    adapter shares with the connector's declaration is the ID and only the id.
