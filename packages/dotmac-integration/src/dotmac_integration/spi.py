"""The connector SPI — what a plugin declares, and what the module checks.

A connector distribution is independently released. The module therefore cannot
import it, cannot enumerate it, and must not contain a provider enum, an import
list or an ``if provider == ...`` branch (ADR-0024 § 7). What it *can* do is
state a contract and refuse anything that does not meet it.

## Three declarations, three refusals

A :class:`ConnectorManifest` declares a stable ``connector_key``, the SPI range
it was built against, and the capabilities it implements. Each maps to exactly
one refusal:

===================== ==========================================================
declaration           refused when
===================== ==========================================================
``connector_key``     two installed distributions claim the same key
``spi_range``         the running module's SPI is outside the declared range
``capabilities``      a binding names a capability the manifest never declared
===================== ==========================================================

All three are checked at **discovery**, again at **startup**, and again at
**activation**. That looks redundant and is not: a distribution can be installed
after discovery ran, and a binding can be activated long after startup, so a
check that happens only once is a check with a window.

## Why the SPI version is stored, not just compared

Sub's platform records ``connector_version`` and ``manifest_digest`` but nothing
about the SPI it was built against — so "an incompatible SPI version refuses
activation" was unenforceable there. Storing the declared range on the
installation is what lets a *later* module upgrade refuse a *previously*
activated binding, which is the case that actually bites: the plugin did not
change, the host did.

## A fourth declaration: the mode, and why it is a CLOSED union

SPI 1.0 shipped :class:`ConnectorMode` with three members and nothing consulting
it. The consequences ran from "cannot work" to "works wrongly": ``INGRESS`` and
``POLL`` had no executable protocol at all, so a webhook connector could be
declared and never run, and ``DELIVERY`` was invoked *without* checking the
declaration, so a binding pointed at an ingress-only connector reached
``handler_for`` and failed with an ``AttributeError`` from inside a lookup —
which reads as a broken plugin rather than as a misconfigured binding.

SPI 1.1 makes each mode an obligation the module verifies. The base
:class:`ConnectorPlugin` carries identity, metadata and connection validation
only; each mode adds exactly one factory in its own protocol
(:class:`DeliveryPlugin`, :class:`IngressPlugin`, :class:`PollPlugin`), and
:data:`MODE_PROTOCOLS` binds mode → protocol → factory → handler shape in one
frozen table.

ADR-0008 says a new vocabulary is a declaration registry, never an enum, and
this module obeys that for the vocabulary that is genuinely open: a capability
id is a regex-validated ``domain.noun.vN`` string with no enum anywhere, because
the module never has to *implement* one — it routes it. A mode is the opposite
kind of name. Each member obliges the **engine** to run machinery only the
engine can supply: ``DELIVERY`` a dispatch worker, ``INGRESS`` a mounted route
and a verify/normalize pipeline, ``POLL`` a scheduler and a cursor it persists.
A product cannot bring that machinery with it, so a product-declared mode would
be a label with nothing behind it — which is precisely how ``POLL`` arrived
unimplementable in 1.0. The union is therefore closed on purpose, closed three
ways, and each way is proved to bite in ``tests/unit/test_integration_spi_modes``:
an ``Enum`` with members cannot be subclassed, ``ConnectorMode("invented")``
raises, and :data:`MODE_PROTOCOLS` is a read-only mapping asserted exhaustive at
import.

## SPI 1.2 adds verification evidence without exposing secret material

``dotmac-integration`` 0.1.0a2 through a4 published SPI 1.1. SPI 1.2 adds
:class:`VerificationResult`: an ingress connector may report only whether
verification succeeded and which POSITIONS in its ordered active-secret set
matched. It cannot report a secret name, reference or value. The host can count
rotation traffic through a provider-neutral observer without importing or
branching on a connector. SPI 1.1's boolean result remains accepted and is
adapted to evidence with no positions, so honest ``>=1.0,<2.0`` connectors keep
working unchanged.

    ingress hooks unchanged.

    ## Nothing is normalised on the way in

    The engine's obligation is to hand over what it received: the body as the
    exact bytes off the wire, and the header and query names and values exactly
    as they arrived — not lowercased, not trimmed, not decoded, not re-encoded.
    This type preserves whatever it is given and adds nothing; an engine that
    normalises before construction has already broken the contract, and no check
    here can see that it did.

    That matters most for `raw_body`. Every provider worth verifying signs the
    bytes and not a re-serialization of them, so a body that has been through
    ``json.loads``/``json.dumps`` fails a signature check that should have
    passed — or, worse, passes one it should have failed.

    ## Why ONE object, and why the SAME one

    Handing the same object to `verify` and `normalize` is the load-bearing
    part: what was authenticated and what was interpreted are then provably the
    same bytes. Separate parameters can drift — an engine that re-read,
    re-decoded or re-assembled the body between the two calls would authenticate
    one thing and normalize another, and a signature check that guards a
    different byte string guards nothing.

    One envelope also stops the contract acquiring an overload per provider. A
    handshake identified by headers as well as query parameters, or a signature
    that travels in the query string, needs no new signature here: every hook
    already sees everything.

    ## Single-valued mappings — a stated limit of 1.1

    `headers` and `params` are ``Mapping[str, str]``. A repeated header or query
    key is therefore not expressible, and an engine handing over one has to pick
    a value. No provider handshake or signature scheme in the requirement record
    repeats a key, so the simpler shape is frozen — and the escape hatch is
    purely ADDITIVE: a later minor may add multi-valued views beside these
    without breaking a single connector, which is why freezing the scalar view
    now costs nothing later.

    ## What makes it safe to pass around

    `frozen` and `slots` together: no hook can mutate what a later hook sees,
    and none can smuggle a database session on as an ad-hoc attribute. The
    mappings are copied and then wrapped in ``MappingProxyType``, so
    immutability is real rather than promised by a type annotation — a plugin
    holding `request.headers` can neither edit the engine's view nor watch a
    caller edit it afterwards.

    `repr=False` is the disclosure rule: this object is a frame local in every
    traceback that leaves the plugin phase, and it holds the raw body, the
    signature header, and any authorization header or cookie a misconfigured
    proxy passed through. A generated `repr` would render all of it into any log
    line, error report or debugger frame that touched the frame. The values are

    A provider's handshake is a raw echo, another's delivery reply must be

    That is provider knowledge, which this module may not hold (ADR-0024 § 7) —
    so the BODY is the connector's, and it is `bytes` rather than `str` for the
    same reason `verify` takes bytes: a provider comparing an exact response
    body is comparing bytes, and an engine-chosen encoding would be a guess.

    ## The split this type exists to draw

    The connector owns the **body** and the **media type**. The engine owns the
    **status code**, and nothing here can express one. That is the point of the
    whole type: a connector must be able to satisfy a provider's exact handshake
    format without being able to lie about whether the engine accepted the
    request.

    * a **status code** is a retry instruction. 200 means "never send this
      again", 5xx means "send it again", 4xx means "stop and page someone". A
      connector choosing it could discard events the engine believes are safely
      persisted, and only the engine knows whether the batch committed.
    * **arbitrary headers** are a response-splitting surface and a place for
      request material to be echoed back out of the module's sight. Neither is
      needed by any handshake in the requirement record, so the capability is
      withheld rather than granted and policed.

    `media_type` is validated against a strict ``type/subtype`` shape precisely
    because it IS a header value: an unvalidated one carrying CRLF is header
    injection with extra steps.

    Three separable jobs, kept separate because they have different inputs and
    different failure meanings. All three receive the same immutable
    :class:`IngressRequest`:

    * `challenge` answers the provider's subscription handshake. It is an
      EXPLICIT operation the engine reaches through its own handshake entry
      point, never inferred from the shape of a request: a bodyless POST is
      still a DELIVERY (a provider that signs an empty body and expects it
      recorded must not get a handshake attempt), and a provider that confirms a
      subscription with a BODIED request must still be able to handshake.
      Returning `None` is a REFUSAL — the engine answers 400 and `verify` is
      never reached.
    * `verify` decides authenticity from `request.raw_body`, which is the body
      exactly as received.
    * `normalize` shapes a verified request into events AND the acknowledgement
      the provider should receive. It is never called on an unverified body.

    ## Why `normalize` builds the acknowledgement

    Because it is the last connector code that runs. The engine records the
    batch after `normalize` returns and emits the acknowledgement only once that
    batch has committed — so the acknowledgement must already exist before
    persistence begins. Calling back into the plugin after the commit would put
    plugin exceptions on the far side of a durable write, where a raise would
    answer 5xx for a batch that is safely stored and the provider would
    redeliver it forever.

    `config` reaches `normalize` because a connector's shape can be
    configuration — a provider variant selects which payload shape to read.
    `secrets` deliberately does NOT: normalization that needs a secret is doing
    verification in the wrong place.

    moves DELIVERY data; an ingress-only connector has no meaningful

    connector to either lie or raise. Worse, dispatch called it without asking
    whether the plugin declared `DELIVERY` at all.

    Each mode now has its own executable protocol, and :func:`verify_plugin_modes`

    Calling the factory and finding it non-null proves almost nothing. A factory
    that hands back a delivery handler where an ingress handler was promised
    satisfies "not None" perfectly and then fails on a provider's request —
    inside a webhook, at 3am, having already answered the provider. So each
    declared mode's factory is called for each declared capability and the
    result is checked against the mode's `handler_protocol`.

    This calls plugin code at boot. That is intended: a factory is a lookup that
    returns a callable, it does not reach a provider, and a factory that cannot
    survive being called at boot is a factory that would not have survived a
    request either.
