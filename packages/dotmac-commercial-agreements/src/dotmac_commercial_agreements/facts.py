"""The versioned facts this module publishes, as values.

An adopting assembly reads these off the platform outbox and reacts —
`dotmac-entitlement-allocation` stages an allocation when an agreement
activates, `dotmac-licensing` issues against that allocation, billing raises the
first invoice. **This module calls none of them.** It records a decision and
emits the fact; the assembly routes it. ADR-0026 § 6 states the rule for
approvals and ADR-0024 states it generally: an owner emits, a consumer's own
authoritative service acts.

## Why the version is in the event type

`agreement.activated.v1`, not `agreement.activated`. A consumer pins a shape.
When the shape changes incompatibly, `v2` is emitted ALONGSIDE `v1` for a
migration window, and a consumer that never migrated keeps working instead of
silently mis-parsing. An unversioned type makes that impossible to do safely,
because there is no way to emit both.

The `v` is part of the string rather than a separate field for the same reason a
routing key is: a relay filters on the type, and a consumer that has to parse a
payload to discover it cannot subscribe to only what it understands.

## The payload carries references, never resolved documents

Every fact names `agreement_id`, `counterparty_ref` and `content_hash`, and
stops. It does not embed the counterparty's name, the release's manifest, or the
approval's policy document — those belong to their owners, and copying them into
an event makes this module a stale second source of each. A consumer that needs
the name asks the owner.

`content_hash` is in every payload deliberately: it is what lets a consumer
prove the fact it is acting on describes the same terms it last saw.
