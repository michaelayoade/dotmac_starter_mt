"""The agreement tables, bound to the `mod_agreements` schema (ADR-0006 D1).

Platform catalog tables: no `tenant_id`, no RLS, `app_user` REVOKEd. A
vendor↔operator commercial agreement is a control-plane fact about the fleet;
no product data plane holds one, and ADR-0057 § 7 declares the plane from that
consumer rather than discovering it from a missing column.

## Three tables, because three things have different lifetimes

- `agreements` — the header and its lifecycle. Mutable in exactly the ways the
  lifecycle allows, and versioned so a stale caller cannot overwrite a decision.
- `agreement_lines` — what is promised. Frozen at proposal and never rewritten;
  an amendment creates a NEW agreement version rather than editing these.
- `agreement_events` — the append-only transition and evidence history. Written
  once per transition, never updated, never deleted, enforced by a trigger
  rather than only by the service.

## No foreign key leaves this schema

`counterparty_ref`, `release_ref`, `offer_ref` and `approval_decision_ref` are
all bare strings with no constraint. That is deliberate three times over:

1. ADR-0006 D1 — a cross-lineage FK splices two independently released
   migration lineages and makes either un-releasable without the other.
2. ADR-0019 § 1 and ruling A3 — `vendor_accounts` must not retire into kernel
   `Party`, so this module holds an opaque counterparty reference and never
   resolves it.
3. An agreement is a legal record that must outlive the rows it references. A
   release superseded, an approval policy retired, or a counterparty record
   merged must not be able to delete or invalidate an executed agreement.

## `accepted_snapshot` is the immutable copy, and `content_hash` is its digest

The snapshot is stored as JSONB rather than reconstructed from the lines on
demand, because reconstruction reads TODAY's lines and the whole point is to
record what was accepted THEN. `content_hash` is the digest of exactly that
document, and it is what approval evidence must bind to — so a change to terms
after approval makes the prior approval stale rather than transferable
(ADR-0026 § 2).

## `record_version` exists because two screens are the ordinary case

Every transition command carries the version the caller believed it was acting
on, and the service refuses a mismatch. Without it, two operators suspending and
reinstating one agreement from two tabs produces a last-writer-wins outcome in
which one operator's decision is silently discarded and the append-only history
records both as successful.

## Status is text with no CHECK

ADR-0008's reason, applied here: adding a lifecycle member should cost a module
release, not an `ALTER TYPE` on every deployment. The legality of a transition
is proven by the service's guard and by the append-only history, both of which
are testable; a CHECK would restate the value set without restating a single
transition rule.
