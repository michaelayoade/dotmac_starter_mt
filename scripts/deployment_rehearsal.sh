# scripts/deployment_rehearsal.sh — Lane 2 of
# docs/inventories/deployment-foundation-rehearsal.md: what a disposable host
# adds that a unit test cannot. Every claim in that document's Lane 2 table
# is proven here against REAL docker, a REAL Postgres, and (for backup and
# migration-head verification) real bytes on disk — not a fake `Effects`
# implementation.
#
# STATUS as of 2026-08-27: Lane 2 has run four times on disposable
# infrastructure. The latest exact-main run, 33111496459 at 9cc24b1e, passed
# steps 1-12 and exposed an unsatisfiable alert-recovery predicate in step 13.
# This branch repairs that predicate; a successful exact-SHA run is still
# required before publication. The script runs ONLY on the disposable
# infrastructure it creates and tears down itself — never against a named
# environment or production host. See scripts/rehearsal/README.md first.
#
# Subcommands:
#   up               create the disposable registry, build+push the image
#                    once, bring up the scratch database, create the
#                    owner/online roles, render the deployment assets.
#   run              the 14 ordered steps from the rehearsal document.
#   inject <case>    one failure-injection case (see `list-cases` for names).
#   down             idempotent teardown. Never `docker compose down
#                    --remove-orphans` — see the comment on that call below.
#   all              up; run; every injection case; down.
#   list-cases       print every case name `inject` accepts.
#
# Everything by config: every path, port, image tag, database name, network
# name and timeout below is a `: "${VAR:=default}"` knob (AGENTS.md,
# "Everything by config"). The one rule that is NOT overridable away: every
# database name and container name this script creates must contain
# "rehearsal" (case-insensitive) — `require_disposable_name` refuses to
# start otherwise. That is the same rule `dotmac_sub`'s integration lane
# applies to its own scratch database, and it is the one thing standing
# between this script and somebody's real database.
