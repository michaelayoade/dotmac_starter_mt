The current workflow has neither a trusted CP-rendered

single historical authorization document cannot authorize a rehearsal. A
future trusted composition may pass the typed plan and exact Control
authorization+dispatch pair through :func:`establish_authorization`; this

clock. Until then the lane reports a non-green, explicit precondition.
