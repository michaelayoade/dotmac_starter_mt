"""Items 12 and 16 — a probe that genuinely originates INSIDE the source set.

Neither item had one. `private_inside.reachable` was the literal `false` and
`privileged_vantage_refused` was `null`, because the collecting host is outside
the accepted set by construction. Both fail closed, which was correct and is not
the same as being executed.

## Item 16 is a reachability measurement; item 12 is a REFUSAL

They are easy to conflate and are different acts.

Item 16 asks whether the private port answers from inside its source set. Item
12 asks that `accept_public_exposure_evidence` REFUSES a real probe from such a
vantage — because a successful connection from a privileged vantage is evidence
that the allowlist works, not that the port is public. That inference produced
two false P0 escalations on 2026-08-29.

So item 12 must observe the OVERLAP branch of that refusal. Its other branch
fires when `membership_established` is false, and a refusal obtained that way
would satisfy the item while proving the opposite thing: that nobody had
established where the vantage sits. The distinction is checked below rather than
assumed, because the vacuous version is the one that arrives by accident.

## v4 and v6 are modelled INDEPENDENTLY, and that is a measured requirement

Michael, 2026-09-04: *"Model inside/outside IPv4 and IPv6 sources
independently."* The inside vantage's own addresses show why. Measured through
the jump:

    v4  160.119.127.195                      Dell segment
    v6  2c0f:e888:12:0:1e98:ecff:fe11:3629   HP-server segment

Its v4 is on the target's segment and its v6 is not. One prefix per vantage
would therefore be wrong for one of the two families, and a source set declared
that way would either admit a segment nobody intended or refuse a probe that is
genuinely inside. Two families, two memberships, decided separately.

## The v6 address is OBSERVED, with a requalification obligation

Michael again: treat it as *"an observed /128 with requalification, not a
permanent hardcoded identity."* It is SLAAC, EUI-64 derived — the `ff:fe` in the
middle — so it is stable while that NIC is and is not a configured address
anybody declared. It is read from the far end at run time and carried as a /128
with :data:`REQUALIFY_EVERY_RUN` set, so a receipt records an address that was
observed on THAT run rather than one a file remembered. A check that hardcoded
it would be asserting a fact about a network card.
