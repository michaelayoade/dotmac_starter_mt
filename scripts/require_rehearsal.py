"""Refuse to publish the deployment facility unless the LANE 3 exposure
rehearsal executed and passed every one of its sixteen items, on the exact SHA.

Lane 3, not Lane 2 — corrected 2026-08-30
-----------------------------------------
This gate used to demand `deployment-rehearsal.yml`, which is **Lane 2**: a real
engine, database, ingress handoff, restore and observability loop. That is a
genuine and valuable proof, and it is a proof of a different thing. `0.3.0a1`'s
entire subject is ADDRESS-FAMILY EXPOSURE, and Lane 2 never watches an IPv6
socket refuse the internet. Gating the release named after that property on a
lane which cannot observe it is the "green preflight reads as attested" failure
with two lanes standing in for two gates.

So the oracle is now `exposure-rehearsal.yml`, and passing the run is no longer
enough on its own: the run publishes a `RehearsalReceipt.v1`, and this gate
reads it. **No `partial`, `not_applicable`, `hand_measured`, `vacuous`,
`incomplete` or missing result can satisfy publication** — only sixteen
`executed_passed`. A Lane 2 receipt offered here is refused by lane number
rather than counted.

Two oracles, deliberately, because they fail differently. The Actions API says a
run of the right workflow completed successfully on this SHA (AGENTS.md rule 30:
an external oracle with immutable coordinates). The receipt says WHAT that run
established. A green run with a receipt full of `blocked` rows is exactly the
shape this pair exists to catch, and either oracle alone would miss it.

Why this exists as CODE and not as a sentence in a document
-----------------------------------------------------------
`dotmac-deployment-foundation` executes migrations, takes and verifies backups,
performs the warm-candidate handoff and rolls back. Every one of those paths is
covered in-repo by a fake `Effects` implementation, which is exactly the right
tool for asserting that the PLAN refuses at the right step — and is incapable of
telling anyone whether a real Docker daemon honours
`service_completed_successfully`, whether a real `pg_dump` produced restorable
bytes, or whether nginx actually drained the old upstream.

`docs/inventories/deployment-exposure-rehearsal.md` said the sixteen items must
close before publication, in a hand-maintained table whose header once claimed
"14 of 16 CLOSED" while the rows below it recorded four `partial` and one `n/a`.
A prose requirement is bypassed by anyone who does not read it, including a
future automation that has no eyes — and a hand-maintained tally can contradict
its own evidence. The status document is now GENERATED from the receipt, and
this gate reads the receipt rather than the document.

The oracle is the GitHub Actions API: the MOST RECENT run of the rehearsal
workflow whose `head_sha` is byte-identical to the SHA under release, which
must itself be completed with conclusion `success`. Newest-then-check, never
check-then-newest — otherwise an old green run masks a newer one that failed,
was cancelled or is still queued. Not a committed file — a committed file is written by
the same hand that wants to publish. Not "a rehearsal ran recently" — a
rehearsal that passed on a different commit says nothing about this one, and
that substitution is the single most likely way this gate would be defeated
while still appearing green.

Fails CLOSED on every ambiguity: a transport error, an unparseable body, zero
runs, a run still in progress, any conclusion other than `success`, and any
`head_sha` mismatch. There is deliberately no `--allow-missing` escape hatch;
the way to publish without a rehearsal is to run the rehearsal.
