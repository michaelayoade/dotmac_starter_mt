# What the TARGET saw as this vantage's source address — read from the far end.
#
# `vantage.qualify_vantage` refuses when this value is empty OR when it
# disagrees with the address the vantage claims. It is the one check measured
# from the far end, and it replaces the discrimination control lost when the
# second NIC was removed: a vantage cannot certify where it egresses from, so
# only the target can say what it saw. Until 2026-09-04 this was the sentinel
# `__TARGET_OBSERVED_V4__`, which is non-empty, so qualification refused through
# the MISMATCH branch and the whole run died before recording a single item.
#
# ## Why ProxyJump and not a listener
#
# The obvious implementation is a listener on the target that prints its peer.
# It is the wrong one: **a listener is a mutation dressed as a read.** It needs a
# port, it collides with the descriptor's declared ports, and it changes the
# target's state in order to measure it.
#
# `-J <vantage>` makes the TCP connection to the target ORIGINATE from the
# vantage while the key stays on the control runner, and `$SSH_CONNECTION` on the
# target is the far end's own report of that connection. Nothing is bound,
# nothing is written, and the observation identity needs no privilege at all.
#
# ## Field ONE, never field four
#
# `SSH_CONNECTION` is `<client-ip> <client-port> <server-ip> <server-port>`.
# Measured 2026-09-04 against the rehearsal target:
#
#   IPv4: 94.72.99.155 48292 10.120.120.54 22
#   IPv6: 2a02:c204:2353:7605::1 36088 2c0f:e888:11::102 22
#
# The CLIENT field is comparable across families and is what this emits. The
# SERVER field is not: on IPv4 it is the target's PRIVATE address because dstnat
# rewrote the destination before it arrived, while on IPv6 it is the public
# address because IPv6 is routed rather than translated. A check written against
# field four would read the private address on v4 and look like a v6-only bug.
#
# ## Two identities, and this one may not change anything
#
# `OBS_USER` is the restricted observation identity: no sudo, no docker group,
# and it cannot read another user's material. The controller identity that
# applies the plan is a DIFFERENT account, deliberately, so a target-side read
# never carries the ability to change the target.
