# Collect the external half of Lane 3, from a vantage that is enumerated first.
#
# Two rules this script exists to enforce mechanically, both learned expensively
# on 2026-08-29:
#
#   1. ENUMERATE THE VANTAGE BEFORE BELIEVING ITS REFUSALS. A host qualified as
#      "outside every allowlist" on the strength of refusals turned out to hold
#      a second NIC into a Dotmac private network. Refusals over one transport
#      were read as refusals over all. So the interface list, the routes and the
#      private-path probes are collected as DATA and handed to
#      `vantage.qualify_vantage`, which refuses rather than assuming.
#
#   2. NEVER PROBE A NEGATIVE AFTER TEARDOWN. A refusal against a port where
#      nothing is listening measures an absent service, not an enforced
#      exposure. Every negative here carries `service_running`, and the runner
#      refuses the item if it is false.
#
# The far-end source addresses are MEASURED as of 2026-09-04 and are no longer
# sentinels. `observe_far_end.sh` reads them from the target itself over a
# ProxyJump through this vantage — see that file for why a listener would have
# been a mutation dressed as a read, and why only field ONE of
# `SSH_CONNECTION` is comparable across families.
#
# TWO fields here are still NOT measurable from this vantage, and are emitted as
# fail-closed placeholders rather than omitted:
#
#   * `probes.private_inside` — item 16 asks whether the private port is
#     reachable from INSIDE its declared source set. This host is outside it by
#     construction, so it emits `reachable: false` and the runner marks item 16
#     FAILED until an authorized-source vantage supplies the real measurement.
#   * `privileged_vantage_refused` — item 12 asks that the refusal fires on a
#     real probe from a vantage INSIDE an accepted source set. Emitted `null`,
#     which the runner treats as FAILED.
#
# Both fail closed on purpose. An absent measurement must never read as a pass,
# and emitting the key with a failing value is louder than omitting it.
#
# `nc` throughout, never bash /dev/tcp: that builtin is absent in this shell and
# reads EVERY port closed, which is a silent all-green — the worst possible
# failure mode for a security probe.
set -euo pipefail

# TWO PHASES, and the split is the whole point of item 13.
#
#   qualify  — BEFORE the controller applies anything. Enumerates the vantage
#              and reads the far end. Collected first so the vantage is
#              qualified against its own interfaces and routes rather than
#              trusted, and so nothing the controller does can contaminate it.
#   probe    — AFTER the apply and BEFORE teardown, which is the only moment a
#              negative means anything. A refusal against a port where nothing
#              is listening measures an absent service, not an enforced
#              exposure, and evidence collected before the stack was applied is
#              an accurate measurement of the wrong instant.
#
# The ordering guarantee the single-phase version had is preserved rather than
# traded away: qualification still happens before any mutation. What moved is
# only the half that has to happen while the service is up.
