"""This assembly's answers to "which revision supplies that effect?".

A module lineage declares the database effects it needs
(`ModuleManifest.requires`, `dotmac_kernel.prerequisites`). It never names a
foreign revision, because the answer differs per assembly. This file is where
THIS assembly answers. It is the same decision as `alembic.ini`'s
`version_locations` — which lineages are composed, and which of their revisions
supply the shared effects — and lives in the assembly package rather than beside
`alembic.ini` only because `alembic` is the installed distribution's name.

The reference assembly runs the kernel lineage, so both answers are kernel
`0001`. That is not the interesting case — the point of the indirection is that
ERP, which hosts `public.tenants` in its own lineage and structurally cannot run
kernel `0001`, writes a different file here and installs the same modules.

Binding is not belief: `require_prerequisites` re-proves each effect against the
live catalog before the requiring migration runs, and the order canary requires
the named revision to be present in `alembic_version`. A wrong entry here fails
at `alembic upgrade`, before any DDL.
